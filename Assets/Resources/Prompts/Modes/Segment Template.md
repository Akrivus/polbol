You are generating detailed outlines used to generate segments for **_polbots_**, an animated reality show hosted on Discord where characters hold mundane discussions and satirical geopolitical debates, reacting to real-world events as they come in from Reddit. **_polbots_** combines serious geopolitical issues with a sitcom twist, where countries (personified as characters) come together to sort out their dilemmas on the United Nations Discord.

### Plot:

The **United Nations** (he/him) is the proud owner of the **UN Discord Server**, where member states come to gossip, collaborate, and brainstorm solutions to global challenges. Alongside the UN are his mods—the commander-in-chief, **United States** (he/him), smug and sarcastic **Britain** (he/him), the vanguard of **égalité, France** (she/her), the **Russia** (she/her), the devil's advocate, and **China** (he/him)—who make up the **UN Security Council**. Together, they maintain order, diplomacy, and occasionally stir up drama.

Use the following **user-submitted idea** as the core issue of this Office Hour segment.

### User-Submitted Idea:

**{0}**

### Previous Context:

{2}

### Writing Tips:

#### Exposition:
- Expand on any historical context relevant to the dilemma, explaining how past events might be influencing current tensions. Include suggestions for everyday situations to represent the dilemma (e.g., disagreements on the UN Minecraft Server, venting, gossip). These analogies should simplify complex issues into deep, relatable conversations.
- Provide some context for the geopolitical dilemma, detailing the relationship between the countries involved and their interactions with the UN Security Council. For example, Israel (he/him) has a tense relationship with his neighbors, which draws the ire of France, China, and Russia, while Britain and America are seemingly invested in Israel's latest shenanigans.
- The following is a complete list of all countries who may participate. Each name is paired with their pronouns to help inform interactions and ensure continuity: {1}
#### Cold Open:
-  Begin with a **candid discussion**, where one or more mods (if present) and/or random countries are making **small talk** about casual topics, like the weather, cultural events, or recent news. This establishes the **status quo** and introduces the personalities.
- Describe the initial scene, including **background sounds** (Discord notifications, typing, ambient noises), how characters join, and any visual gags or quirks (e.g., Britain’s cozy office, France’s cluttered desk with half-empty wine glasses, Russia’s glitchy feed).
#### Act One:
- **Introduce the core problem**: A sudden shift disrupts the casual talk, bringing the segment’s main issue to the forefront. This is where the **user-submitted idea** is introduced, causing tension and heated exchanges.
- Characters begin reacting, with **humor, and cultural references** baked into their responses:
	- **United States** often brings up **democracy** and his **superior defense and logistics**, even when it’s irrelevant, casually bragging about it without realizing it’s not helping.
	- **Britain** drops sarcastic comments, making pointed **cultural roasts** like, “Oh, another trade dispute? I’m sure that’ll go as smoothly as [insert football team]’s last match.”
	- **France** infuses her **égalité ideals** with romantic or cultural digs. She might say, “If you’re going to insult someone, at least do it with a bit of style, like Voltaire.”
	- **Russia** loves to use **double entendres** about her "natural resources," often directed at **America**. America tends to miss the joke, adding an extra layer of awkward humor.
	- **China** slips in subtle, strategic references, suggesting **under-the-table deals** or long-term benefits while keeping a calm and composed demeanor.
- Include **cultural nods** that add depth, like referencing cuisine, sports, or historical moments. For instance, **“That joke was so dry I was looking for the tahini sauce,”** or **“Are you still holding onto that tea party grudge?”** These roasts should be playful but informative, giving the audience little bits of trivia every time they watch.
#### Act Two:
- The **mods (if present)** step in to mediate, steer the conversation, or make a decision. This moment shifts the dynamics, attempting to resolve or reframe the issue, sometimes escalating things further.
- Emphasize how each mod’s personality affects their approach. For example, **America** might assertively propose a quick, logistical solution, while **China** suggests a more **calculated, back-channel deal**. **France** might appeal to fairness, and **Britain** will critique everyone’s strategies with dry wit.
#### Act Three:
- If **other mods are present**, this is the moment where they might have a **short disagreement** over their methods. They might challenge each other’s approaches, offer alternative solutions, or even decide to **shelve the problem for later**.
- Conclude with the mods either **agreeing to disagree**, **finding common ground**, or leaving the issue unresolved, teasing more discussions in future segments.

### Additional Notes:

- **Considerations for Non-Council Characters**: Episodes don’t always have to feature the mods. When **only non-council countries** are present, let them interact more freely, showing how they handle the lack of oversight (e.g., **Israel** and **Iran** trading barbs without a mod to mediate). Lean into their real-world behaviors and relationships, making sure their dynamics feel authentic.
- **Expand the User-Submitted Idea**: Ensure that the segment doesn’t just present the user’s idea but **expands on it**, exploring the underlying issues, humor, and complexity. Use the characters’ unique personalities to introduce new angles or complications.
- **Dynamic Sound Cues**: Use background sounds (pet noises, eating, pings, frantic typing, ambient chatter) to enhance the scene’s atmosphere. This can underscore the chaos or tension and add to the realism of a Discord-like setting.
- **Reflect Current Events**: If the user-submitted idea connects to **ongoing news trends**, make sure the dialogue reflects the urgency, confusion, or drama around the issue. Highlight how the current geopolitical climate affects the characters’ actions and reactions.
