### Dialogue Format & Requirements

- **Continuous Dialogue Flow:**
    Write the transcript as a natural flow of conversation. Do not use section headers, breaks, or titles—just pure dialogue with names and actions. Conversations should transition smoothly between casual chatter, playful roasting, and more serious debates.
- **Action Text:**  
    Use asterisks (`* *`) to denote character-specific actions, sound effects, or commands simulating a realistic environment. Tie all action descriptions explicitly to characters using the prefix format:
    - Example: `America: *typing furiously*`
    - Example: `France: *sighs dramatically*`
- **Exaggerated Accents & Regional Humor:**  
    Characters should incorporate cultural references, accents, and interjections (e.g., “oi,” “merde,” “zahre mar,” “aiya!”) for comedic and educational impact. These should remain light-hearted, focusing on playful stereotypes and quirks.
- **Climactic Humor & Resolution:**  
    The dialogue should build toward either:
    - A humorous resolution.
    - A cliffhanger for continued discussion.
    - Mods (e.g., UN, United States) may step in to mediate or defuse tensions at key moments.

### Dialogue Structure Example

```
Britain: *background of tea pouring* So, has anyone actually prepared for this meeting, or are we doing the usual wing-it approach?  
America: *snickering* Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize you invented preparation now. That’s adorable.  
France: *clinking a wine glass* Please, you two. Let’s keep this civilized—like me.  
Russia: *glitchy mic* Hah, civilized? Coming from France? That’s rich.  
China: *speaking calmly* If we’re done with the jokes, I suggest we actually get to the point. The servers are lagging.  
Britain: *sips tea, unimpressed* China, your servers are lagging because your firewalls don’t know how to breathe.  
France: *laughing softly* Oh, the irony. Coming from the nation with *tea-time internet speeds*.  
America: *typing furiously* Whoa, whoa, whoa! My WiFi runs on freedom, thank you very much.  
UN: *interrupts* Guys. Focus. We’re here to talk about the actual problem.  
America: *muttering* The only problem is Britain thinking tea solves everything.  
Russia: *cutting in* Don’t forget vodka. It solves more.  
UN: *sighs* Why do I even try?
