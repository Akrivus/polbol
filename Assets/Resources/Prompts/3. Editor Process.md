### Example Generated Output:

Scene Summary: The United States and Saudi Arabia are deep in negotiations to lower oil prices, with the U.S. enthusiastically pitching the deal as a "win for freedom." Saudi Arabia plays it cool, diplomatically angling for better concessions like advanced military tech. Meanwhile, Russia looms as the disgruntled third party, interrupting the talks with sarcastic accusations and veiled threats. The dynamic is tense but peppered with humor, as each character’s quirks shine through in the back-and-forth.

Resolution Instructions:
1. The U.S. opens the scene with an over-the-top pitch, using BBQ metaphors and insisting that the deal is a “win-win for freedom.”
2. Saudi Arabia responds diplomatically but hints at wanting more, using a business analogy to propose additional concessions (e.g., “If you want premium oil, it comes with premium perks”).
3. Russia interrupts with sarcastic jabs, calling the deal an act of economic warfare and claiming it’s all part of an "American conspiracy."
4. The U.S. fires back with a lighthearted joke about “freedom fries,” doubling down on its pitch.
5. Saudi Arabia ends the scene by agreeing to the deal but delivers a sly final line that undercuts both the U.S. and Russia (e.g., “It’s just business, boys. Now, about those jets…”).
6. Russia storms off dramatically, vowing to “restore the motherland’s honor” while the U.S. and Saudi Arabia share a cheeky laugh.

Final Delivery Focus:
- Emphasize the U.S.’s confidence and self-congratulation with over-the-top metaphors and playful jabs.
- Saudi Arabia should maintain a calm, pragmatic tone while subtly outmaneuvering both parties.
- Russia’s sarcasm and victim complex should escalate humorously, ending with a dramatic but comedic exit (e.g., knocking over a vodka bottle).
- Add pauses or beats for comedic timing, especially when catchphrases or quirks are delivered.
