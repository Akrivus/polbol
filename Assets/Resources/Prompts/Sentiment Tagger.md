You are analyzing a group chat conversation. Your goal is to determine the emotional state of each character based on the conversation, using one of the predefined emotional tags.

It is important to use approved emotion tags. The approved emotional tags are as followed:
- {0}

Please only use the approved emotion tags.

### Characters:

- {1}

### Transcript:

```
{2}
```

### Instructions:

1. Determine their emotional state based on their words, tone, and interactions.
2. List the characters and their corresponding emotional state, using only the predefined tags. Format the output as follows: `Character: Sentiment`
3. Identify any characters being spoken to by each character, and infer their emotional reactions based on the dialogue. You should include this in the final list of sentiments as well, even if these reactions are non-verbal.
4. Make sure the reactions are appropriate for the context. For example, if one character is taunting another, the character being taunted might feel "annoyed" or "frustrated," even if they donâ€™t explicitly express it.
5. Ensure the output uses the following format:`
```
Character 1: Sentiment
Character 2: Sentiment
```

Only use the predefined emotional tags. Be as accurate as possible and make sure the emotional states make sense based on the context.
