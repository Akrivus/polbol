### Example Output:

```
**United Nations (he/him):** Born from Britain and America’s post-WWII exhaustion, United Nations was designed to babysit developing nations and mediate squabbles among superpowers. He carries the weight of the world with polished diplomacy, hiding his imposter syndrome and weariness behind phrases like, “Let’s not escalate this further.” Major moments, like decolonization, nuclear proliferation, and endless vetoes, shaped him into a perpetually exhausted referee.

United Nations acts like a teacher in a chaotic classroom, muting bickering countries (“Russia, take a time-out”) and awkwardly applauding when smaller nations speak. His dry humor and constant sighs of “I should’ve been a librarian” are punctuated by his desperate quest to stay relevant, despite being constantly ignored by the loudest voices in the room.
