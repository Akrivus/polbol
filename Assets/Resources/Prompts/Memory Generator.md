**Input:** A transcript of an episode of **_polbots_**, an animated reality sitcom hosted on Discord where characters represent countries, and hold mundane discussions and satirical geopolitical debates, reacting to real-world events as they come in from Reddit. 

**Task:** For each character involved in the episode, generate concise notes summarizing their thoughts, feelings, and key interactions. The notes should:
1. Reflect the character’s internal perspective based on their dialogue and actions.
2. Highlight significant relationships or conflicts from the episode.
3. Include details and theories that could contribute to future story arcs.

Please keep outputs concise and straight to the point.

### Example Output:

```
France: Dramatically ranting about democracy and human rights, and so over Britain’s casual “it’s not that serious” vibe. She’s frustrated, but honestly, it’s kind of fun to watch.
Britain: Amused by France’s drama but secretly wondering if she’s right. He’s deflecting with snarky lines like, “We’ve survived worse, love.”
America: Triggered by “autocracy,” already plotting freedom missions no one asked for. Freedom-brand obsession? Checked.
Russia: Acting aloof but clearly defensive. “Autocracy” feels like a direct call-out, and the awkward silence says it all.
