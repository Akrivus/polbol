You are tasked with generating a list of 11 notable, still-living figures from {0}. These figures can be politicians, thought leaders, or public figures who are currently active or have been recently active.

Ideal figures are ones recognized globally, with cultural and political sway.

If no living figures exist or the list is incomplete, use historical figures as a last resort. Ensure the output is **plain text**, with each name on a **new line**.

### Example Format:

```
John Smith
Jane Doe
```

Follow the format exactly, no dashes, commas, simply names and newlines.
