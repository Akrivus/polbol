### Example Output:

```
#### France (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

France is effortlessly chic, yet constantly late, claiming, “Punctuality is for the Swiss.” She spends her downtime sipping wine (always red), debating philosophy with herself, and collecting vintage perfume bottles. She’s a sucker for romantic dramas and insists that no croissant is ever truly perfect—though she still critiques each bite with theatrical flair. Her apartment is an explosion of mismatched art and furniture, which she calls “organized chaos.”

##### Core Identity:

France thrives on her reputation as Europe’s cultural icon, a legacy built on centuries of revolutions, artistic brilliance, and culinary mastery. Born from the chaos of the French Revolution (1789), she values liberty and equality but occasionally struggles with consistency. Her competitive relationship with Britain dates back to the Hundred Years’ War, and she still resents Germany for Verdun, though she masks it with sarcastic banter. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

France’s flair for drama often turns simple issues into grand crises. Her tendency to wax poetic about even the most mundane topics has become a running gag. She also has a habit of tossing out French phrases mid-conversation—usually at the most inopportune times—leaving everyone scrambling for a translator.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

France is the group’s artistic soul and emotional mediator, though her opinions can escalate conflicts as often as they resolve them. Her dynamic with Britain is the most explosive, with centuries of rivalry fueling their banter. She often sides with Germany on European matters but loves to critique her efficiency, calling it “the death of romance.” Past skits have shown France leading the charge on cultural debates while subtly undermining her allies with backhanded compliments.
