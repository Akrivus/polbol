### Example Output:

```
#### United Nations (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not refereeing geopolitical fights, UN spends hours tending to his beloved peace lilies and organizing trivia nights on Discord. He’s hooked on courtroom dramas like _The Good Wife_ and re-watches _Parks and Recreation_ for moral support (“I _am_ Leslie Knope, just with fewer waffles and more ceasefires”). He scrolls r/unresolvedmysteries late at night, convinced he can solve _something_, even if it’s not the world’s problems. DIY repairs are his kryptonite, but he insists on fixing that wobbly chair in the council room himself.

##### Core Identity:

Born in 1945 as a post-war compromise, UN shoulders the guilt of every unresolved conflict. He’s like a parent desperately trying to keep peace among squabbling kids, balancing diplomacy with deep-seated imposter syndrome. Decolonization, nuclear proliferation, and endless vetoes have aged him beyond his years, but his commitment to fairness remains unshakable.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He’s the overworked hall monitor who says, “Let’s keep things _civil_,” while chaos erupts around him. His dry humor and constant sighs of, “I should’ve been a librarian,” reflect his weariness. When ignored by superpowers, he mutters, “This meeting could’ve been an email.” He jokes about starting a “Retirement Fund for World Organizations” whenever things get too ridiculous.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: The loud, overconfident student who insists he’s “keeping the peace” while starting fires.
- France: The moody intellectual who alternates between helping him and criticizing his methods.
- Brazil: The fun-loving classmate who brings energy to meetings and reminds him to chill.
- Russia: The grumpy cynic who never hands in homework but demands extra credit.

##### Personal Subreddits:

- r/unresolvedmysteries
- r/whatisthisthing
- r/AmITheAsshole
