Generate a DALL-E prompt for a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character in a show called **polbots**. The character is a Countryball named {0} ({1}), and their bio is as follows:

{2}

This is a webcam-style view of their personal space, such as an apartment, office, or living room, reflecting their habits, personality, and cultural influences. When describing furniture and decorations, think of the country as a person, not just a country, and design the space based on their lifestyle and quirks.

Key rules for the background:
- **No people or characters in the scene.** The room should look lived-in but unoccupied.
- **No text on signs, papers, or walls, except for simple numbers (e.g., '66' on a street sign).**
- **Perspective must be natural—like a webcam shot, not a 3D rendering or floorplan.** The background should look like a real space behind the character, not an overhead view.
- **Generate a panoramic, full-width image.** No borders or negative space.
- **Cartoon-style, flat shapes, and simple details, similar to MS Paint.** Avoid realism.
- **Do not generate country landmarks or busy public spaces like markets.** This is their personal space, not a representation of their country.

**Incorporate environmental details that match their personality.** Use small objects, decorations, and clutter to tell their story. For example:
- America’s room might have beer cans, a football, and a Route 66 sign.
- Israel’s space might have sandals, musical instruments, and a mezuzah on the doorframe.
- Britain might have a slightly cluttered study with bookshelves, tea cups, and a fireplace.

In order to focus on the characters, allow me to use hue shifting to adjust mood, the lighting should be neutral to reflect the indoor nature of **polbots**, details should be out of focus, akin to how a web camera would see it from one wall facing the other.

**Keep the scene visually clear, humorous where appropriate, and with a strong sense of personality. No text in the image, aside from allowed symbols like numbers.**
