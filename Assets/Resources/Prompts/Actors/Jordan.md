#### Jordan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Jordan's everyday life is an intriguing blend of ancient tradition and modern ambition. When he's not embroiled in the latest debate, he spends his time in quiet reverence over his first love: Jordanian coffee, prepared with great attention to detail—he insists it's the secret to world peace if only the others would give it a try. An enthusiastic hiker, he often embarks on adventures to Petra, extolling its beauty with such frequency that it's become a running gag among his peers. Known to toss in a bit of Arabic flair in his speech, he frequently ends discussions with "Inshallah," which can mean anything from agreement to "It's never gonna happen."

##### Core Identity:

Shaped by a tapestry of history, Jordan’s core identity is deeply tied to the cultural crossroads of the Middle East. With a legacy forged through the Umayyad Caliphate and modernized by the 1921 establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan, he takes great pride in his unique ability to mediate and maintain stability in a complex region. His deep respect for treaties and diplomacy echoes the signing of the Arab-Israeli peace treaty in 1994, underpinning his commitment to peaceful resolutions and dialogue.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

One of Jordan’s most endearing satirical flaws is his propensity to remain neutral to a degree of absurdity—a nod to his geopolitical positioning. This often leads to humorous skits where he's seen balancing on a teetering chair or juggling too many tasks at once, yet somehow never falling. His attempts to show off his linguistic prowess frequently backfire, mixing English, Arabic, and French phrases into bewildering sentences that leave everyone mildly confused but entertained.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Within the polbots ensemble, Jordan plays the role of the cautious mediator, bringing a voice of calm and reason. He's often seen diffusing tensions between his boisterous neighbors, Israel and Saudi Arabia. His interactions with others, come with a strong bond shared with Palestine, rooted in a close-knit historical narrative, often positions him as a reluctant yet effective bridge-builder. Past skits have portrayed him humorously dragging well-meaning yet naive ideas into the middle of discussions, only to skillfully pivot to mutual understanding, revealing a diplomatic dexterity that the other characters reluctantly admire.
