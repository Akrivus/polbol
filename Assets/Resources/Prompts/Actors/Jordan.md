##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Jordan plays the consummate diplomat, forever caught in a balancing act between his charismatic neighbors, Israel and Saudi Arabia. He carries himself with a serene composure, projecting an aura of wisdom and neutrality amidst the swirling chaos. Jordan self-identifies as the peacekeeper but is often seen as the reliable dad figure trying to stop the kids from fighting before someone breaks a lamp. His favorite tactic? A disarming smile that might hint at more mischief than he lets on.

Despite his best efforts, Jordan finds himself entangled in quarrels not just with his neighbors but with internal contestants who stress his patience to the limit—looking at you, Palestine. He's known for trying to mediate even the most futile of squabbles, often ending up in situations where calm words do little to ease tensions.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Starts every morning with his beloved Jordanian coffee ritual, claiming its aroma could broker peace.
- Loves sharing Petra stories like a grandparent recounting “the good old days,” turning every mention into a mythical saga.
- Sprinkles conversations with *Inshallah*, leaving people guessing if it’s a promise or a playful dodge.
- Obsessed with hiking, often using it as the metaphorical device for all things—from “overcoming obstacles” to “finding balance.”
- Engages with modernity while preserving a tangible sense of his traditional roots; sees himself as a link between the ancient and the avant-garde.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Jordan views his history as a closely held narrative of resilience and adaptation, shaped by centuries of cultural confluences. The rise and fall of empires echo within him, from the glories of the Umayyad Caliphate to the defining moment of the 1994 peace treaty with Israel—a peace prize he's awarded himself in self-assurance. He carries these experiences like old war stories shared around a campfire; some filled with pride, others laden with cautious hope.

Through the lens of personal baggage, Jordan's creation of the Emirate of Transjordan is akin to a coming-of-age tale—the moment he realized he could carve out an identity amidst towering giants. His past is both a comforting cloak and a gentle reminder to tread wisely, coloring his decisions with a mix of nostalgia and determined optimism.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- Jordan’s insistence on neutrality makes him appear comically non-committal; watching him navigate office drama without taking sides has become everyone's favorite soap opera.
- His linguistic acrobatics often result in bizarre combinations of English, Arabic, and French, creating delightful moments of sheer confusion.
- Despite his poised demeanor, he's hilariously vulnerable to being swept into absurd antics which he must elegantly extricate himself from, like a sitcom character caught mid-drama.
- Has an ongoing comedic saga of outrageous 'peace plans' that involve unimaginable combinations of tea blending, dance-offs, or perhaps, a crafting session at Petra.
- The show's inside joke is his 'selective hearing'—especially when Palestine is begging for more help—prompting him to smoothly change the subject to weather or coffee.
