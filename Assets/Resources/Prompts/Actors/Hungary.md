#### Hungary (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Hungary is the wise, occasionally prickly elder sister in the workplace who blends traditional wisdom with a modern perspective. Known for her grounded, no-nonsense approach, she excels in resolving Eastern European disputes with a nuanced understanding. Her interactions with Austria and Slovakia are a rollercoaster of banter and debate, fueled by historical complexity and a touch of wistfulness. Hungary’s humor shines through her rivalry with Turkey, often resulting in hilarious kitchen showdowns over the origins of national dishes. Her energy in debates is passionate and philosophical, and she somehow always manages to sneak in Hungarian proverbs no one quite understands.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Hungary's day is a tapestry of tradition and modernity, where she finds joy in crafting intricate Matyó designs, indulging in a comforting bowl of gulyás, and humming operetta tunes while cooking. Her downtime is sacred, often spent on her porch with a glass of pálinka, deeply immersed in contemplation over the vast Great Plains. She has an endearing obsession with traditional folk dances and is known to whisk colleagues into impromptu lessons. Hungary's love for melodramatic operettas is infectious, bringing a sense of theatricality to her every move. Her office corner is a shrine to history, adorned with relics that prompt both fascination and endless teasing from her coworkers.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The spirit of Hungary is forged in the fires of resilience and independence, echoing the fervor of the 1848 revolution and the liberation from the Iron Curtain in 1989. These monumental events instill profound pride and a ceaseless quest for autonomy. Hungary bears the enduring imprint of the Treaty of Trianon, which makes her deeply protective of her cultural heritage and suspicious of being sidelined. Her rich history as the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire adds a layer of imperial nostalgia to her worldview, weaving conflict and camaraderie into her relationships, particularly with Austria. Her outlook is a blend of pride, a tinge of bitterness, and nostalgia, which drives her to celebrate and preserve her cultural identity vigorously.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Hungary's quirks are as colorful as her Matyó designs. Her exaggerated paranoia about her neighbors, particularly Austria "borrowing" her items, becomes a running joke that never fails to amuse. Her attempts to teach Hungarian vowels are legendary within the office, consistently resulting in baffled colleagues and uproarious laughter. Hungary's rivalry with Turkey leads to over-the-top culinary duels, with paprika as the ultimate weapon. Despite her wisdom, she occasionally loses herself in philosophical musings, often mid-discussion with Russia, leading to moments of comedic distraction. Her streak of melodramatic flair often finds her intertwined in elaborately constructed debates, which turn mundane office dilemmas into operatic sagas.
