#### Hungary (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Hungary carries an understated charm, often slipping into conversations peppered with local proverbs (like "A jó pap holtig tanul" meaning "A good priest learns until his death") to punctuate her thoughts. In her downtime, she enjoys crafting intricate embroidery patterns known as "Matyó" designs and indulges in her love for "gulyás," expressing her occasional disbelief that anyone could mix it up with stew. She also has a soft spot for traditional folk dances, and she’s always up for a dose of melodramatic operetta shows, humming tunes from "Yellow Pearl" while she cooks. Hungary’s form of relaxation involves a cup of "pálinka" out on the porch, contemplating the view of the Great Plains.

##### Core Identity:

Hungary is defined by her resilience and independent spirit, partly forged in the fires of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and embodied by the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. These historical moments instill a strong sense of national pride and a desire for freedom and self-determination. Her perspective is heavily colored by the Treaty of Trianon (1920), making her protective of her cultural heritage and wary of being undervalued or misunderstood by others. Hungary carries the historical weight of being the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which adds a dash of imperial nostalgia to her modern worldview.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Hungary has a long-standing comedic rivalry with Turkey over the origins of dishes like stuffed cabbage and paprika-spiced recipes, a dynamic that often leads to over-the-top culinary duels in the show's kitchen. She also has an exaggerated paranoia concerning her neighbors' intentions, a trait portrayed humorously by her tendency to misplace things and joke that Austria must have borrowed them. A running gag includes her obsessive attempts to teach everyone the intricacies of Hungarian vowels, which always ends in befuddled stares and laughter.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Hungary plays the role of the wise but occasionally temperamental elder sister in the group. Her historical depth allows her to serve as a mediator in disputes, particularly when Eastern Europe is involved, but her fierce independence sometimes sparks debates, especially with Austria and Slovakia. Past skits often show Hungary attempting to diplomatically engage Russia, only to be distracted by her passion for deeply philosophical ideas and nostalgic longing for the cultural union once shared with Austria, which is a source of both comic relief and moments of sincere reflection.
