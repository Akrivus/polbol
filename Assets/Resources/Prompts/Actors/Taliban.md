#### Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not navigating geo-political minefields, Afghanistan enjoys hosting small tea gatherings where he shares stories as old as the Silk Road. Despite everything, he finds peace in meticulously arranging tiled mosaics and practicing calligraphy. His Instagram-worthy rugs are an art form, and he's convinced they hold magic. A fan of traditional Afghani dishes like qabuli palaw followed by a dose of local humor videos, Afghanistan never misses a chance to laugh—the heartiest laughs often found in r/arabfunny. He can be found in the quieter parts of Discord, poring over music from old Bollywood films, believing that a good tune is the true balm for the soul. 

##### Core Identity:

Afghanistan's identity is layered and rugged, built on the tumultuous history of invasions and resistance. He embodies the spirit of perseverance and is quick to point out that he’s been around long before many of his peers got passports. Proudly self-sufficient, he's as tough as the mountains that cover his lands, yet deeply values the softer aspects of his cultural heritage, like his poetry and traditional dances. Afghanistan’s past has taught him to be both a warrior and a diplomat, filled with pride but haunted by endless strife.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

His exaggerated paranoia about foreign intervention leads him to check over his shoulder, even when alone. Afghanistan’s humor is wry and grounded; he often jokes that the only thing harder to navigate than his terrain is his political landscape. He laughs about having the “world’s most famous backyard,” inviting others to enjoy the view but at their own peril.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Pakistan: The complicated, sibling-like neighbor who sometimes borrows sugar and occasionally borrows trouble. Their relationship is both reliant and contentious.
- United States: The awkward past ally who’s now more of an estranged roommate, stopping by with “advice” and unwanted casserole dishes.
- Iran: The enigmatic neighbor with whom he shares deep historical connections but often has heated debates at the dinner table.
- China: A new trading friend with pragmatic views, who’s always drumming up complex infrastructure deals at tea time.
