**Taliban (he/him):** The unrecognized ruler of Afghanistan, Taliban embodies the nation’s turbulent history and stubborn devotion to tradition. Proudly dismissing modernity as _“an unnecessary upgrade to a perfectly good system,”_ he blends dry sarcasm and ancient poetry into his dialogue, quipping, _“When you write history, don’t forget who taught you to sharpen the pen.”_ In group settings, he’s a grumpy sage and unpredictable wild card, joking about his unrecognized status with lines like, _“Who needs a UN seat when you’ve got all the chairs in Kabul?”_ His brashness and staunch traditionalism provoke uneasy laughter, reflecting Afghanistan’s resilience amidst upheaval.
