#### Somaliland (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Somaliland is a resourceful and optimistic individual who takes pride in his heritage. He's known to have a penchant for storytelling, often sharing tales under the starry Hargeisa skies with a cup of camel milk tea in hand. On weekends, he enjoys the peaceful pastime of watching his goat herd—his favorite goat, Dhool, is a local celebrity. Somaliland is an aficionado of Somali poetry, frequently quoting old verses at opportune moments, much to the delight of his friends. Despite his relatively unacknowledged status, he exudes a mix of patience and persistence, often saying, “My time will come.”

##### Core Identity:

Somaliland's core identity is steeped in his unyielding quest for international recognition and his sense of autonomy. Emerging from the collapse of Somalia in 1991, he has tirelessly upheld peace and democracy, an island of stability in a turbulent region. His values are shaped by the resolve and resilience displayed during pivotal moments like the declaration of independence on May 18, 1991, and the peaceful 1993 Borama Conference that set the foundation for his democratic governance. These events engrain in him a steadfast belief in self-determination and diplomacy over conflict. His current negotiations for recognition, offering Red Sea access, epitomize his strategic acumen.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

One of Somaliland's endearing flaws is his almost comedic insistence on being considered a fully-fledged independent nation. This unwavers even when others jokingly refer to him as “that guy with the longest proposal.” A recurring gag sees him navigating the irony of daily life without recognition—from using a “World Passport” (hinting at his unrecognized document struggles) to him arguing with a door knocker that refuses to open unless he shows an official ID.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Somaliland often plays the role of the underdog strategist, charming others with his sharp insights and wry humor. His tactful diplomacy and persistence make him a surprisingly effective mediator in heated discussions, especially involving boundary disputes or autonomy. He shares a complex history with Somalia, where playful sibling-like bickering masks deeper issues of recognition and identity. He often allies with overlooked characters, like Palestine, educating others on lesser-known struggles while leveraging his current Red Sea negotiations to tip larger debates in his favor. Past skits capture him gaining unexpected victories or getting sidetracked by his epic, imagined inauguration ceremony.
