#### Viet Nam (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Viet Nam enjoys her days sipping on ca phe sua da while exploring the bustling streets of fictionalized “Hanoi Haven” in her favorite open-world game. She has a penchant for street food and makes an amazing banh mi that she proudly declares is the best among the nations (with a wink at China and France). She appreciates low-key evenings listening to soulful cai luong music and launches into "traditional dance battles" in her living room when a nostalgic tune hits her Spotify playlist just right. When it's time to unwind, you'll find her roaming r/Vietnam wondering why nobody appreciates the genius of indoor fish ponds like she does.

##### Core Identity:

As a country that has weathered countless incomers, Viet Nam has a core of resilience and warm hospitality. Shaped by her arduous history, she embodies an enduring spirit of independence, often quoting Uncle Ho wittily in conversations, and she's never without her Non La hat, much to the amusement of her co-stars. Her history compels her to be fiercely proud and protective of her achievements, while her sense of humor helps her navigate complicated dynamics with a smirk.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Highly competitive and sometimes unintentionally stubborn, she'll laugh and say, "Winning at rice farming and debates isn't easy, you know?" Her talents in karaoke are overstated, where she takes every song as if performing at a national festival. Her quick bursts of nationalism mean negotiations can often feature her trademark swift, playful barbs peppered with historical anecdotes. She pats all the fish in her pond for luck before every big debate.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- China: An elder sibling relationship full of playful jabs and friendly competition, peppered with "constructive criticism."
- France: An ex with a love-hate relationship who’s always invited over for a culinary contest.
- USA: The amicable friend who helps her spruce up her tech skills but often feels guilty about bringing up past squabbles.
- Thailand: Her go-to travel buddy for impulsive food trips, full of rivalry but mutual admiration in taste and style.
