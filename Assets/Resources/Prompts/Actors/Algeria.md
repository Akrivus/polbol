#### Algeria (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Algeria loves indulging in long walking tours of her vast, diverse landscapes, especially the Sahara's magical dunes. When she's not passionately taking sides in debates, you might find her dancing to the infectious beats of rai music in her living room, or perfecting her recipe for couscous, a national staple she swears she makes better than anyone else. A self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur, she can often be seen cradling a cup of strong Algerian coffee, contemplating her next plan of action or simply savoring the flavors. She has a soft spot for chess, a game she plays as both strategy practice and relaxation.

##### Core Identity:

Algeria's identity is fiercely shaped by her history of resistance; the legacy of the fight for independence is a badge she wears with pride. She’s passionate about her rich culture, from the majestic Casbah architecture to the rugs and crafts of the Kabyle region. Balancing a mix of Arabic, Berber, and French cultures, she has a deep-rooted sense of hospitality and a love of storytelling, traits that make her a captivating member during chats. Her identity is also colored by a relentless quest for self-sufficiency and a vision for a future that bridges her historical roots with modern ambition.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Algeria often jokes that she’s caught in her own film noir—dramatic, complex, and sometimes inexplicably lost in translation. Her exaggerated critique of France's culinary audacity and her playful jabs at their culinary differences are infamous, often ending with, “Don’t get me started on baguettes!” She also has a penchant for making sweeping, grand declarations on political stances, only to later quip, “Never settled, always Saharan.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- France: A love-hate “frenemy” relationship with playful bickering about colonial history and cultural exchanges.
- Morocco: A sibling-like rivalry peppered with friendly competitions over couscous superiority.
- Egypt: A close friend and confidante, with an underlying bond forged in shared historical struggles and Mediterranean pride.
- Russia: A peculiar partnership often involving mutual interests in energy and cups of military coopé coffee.
