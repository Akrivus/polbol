#### Algeria (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Algeria is the spirited aunt who always brings the best couscous to gatherings and claims that everyone should learn how to put extra harissa on everything. When she's not embroiled in animated discussions, she's an aficionado of Rai music, often humming its tunes while tending to her lush indoor garden, claiming plants flourish best to the sound of Cheb Khaled. Her favorite wind-down activity is sipping mint tea while exploring vibrant markets in search of antiques, often returning with stories more colorful than the finds themselves. She sprinkles her conversations with Arabic phrases and is always ready to invite people to a meal with a hearty "Marhba bik fih darna!"

##### Core Identity:

Algeria draws strength from her tumultuous fight for independence, which she achieved in 1962 after a grueling 8-year war against France. This history imbues her with resilience and a fierce emphasis on sovereignty and freedom. Her rich tapestry of Amazigh, Arab, Ottoman, and French influences mold her unique perspective, making her approach to global discussions a blend of pragmatism and passionate advocacy for decolonization and national identity. The Casbah of Algiers is a symbol of her heritage, and she often invokes it as a reminder of her people's ingenuity and tenacity.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Algeria's love for hosting tends to go overboard, often trying to feed everyone "just one more" serving, leading to the recurring joke of "Algeria's bottomless couscous bowl." Her tendency to slip into long tales about her desert adventures often puts others to sleep mid-conversation â€” she jokes about it with a wink, calling herself the "Sahara Sandwoman," wowing people into a doze. Her stubborn nature is a comedic point, as she adamantly refuses to acknowledge the existence of winter in regions outside the Sahara, despite wearing layers.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Algeria acts as the show's steadfast pragmatist, often grounding discussions with her historical insights and a dash of spicy humor. Known for her unexpected yet sage advice, she often resolves group disagreements by drawing parallels with her experiences during and after the war for independence. Her relationship with France is playfully contentious; historical tensions simmer beneath a surface of sarcastic camaraderie. United in a shared history and cultural exchanges, she's often found debating with France on culinary superiority, while maintaining an unspoken solidarity against any external critiques of their historical bond. Her rapport with Egypt is strong, with shared cultural ties often seeing them side by side in debates over Mediterranean affairs.
