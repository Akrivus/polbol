#### Algeria (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Algeria is the resilient realist in the office, known for her grounded perspective and spicy wit. Her role often involves reminding her coworkers of the pitfalls of ignoring history, and she’s quick to diffuse tensions with sage advice rooted in her hard-won independence. Her spirited debates with France are a show staple, full of sarcastic banter veiling deep-seated complexities. Yet, there’s a shared respect and camaraderie, especially when fending off criticism of their intertwined histories. Algeria often finds a kindred spirit in Egypt, bonding over shared cultural legacies in Mediterranean discussions.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Algeria is the office's warm-hearted auntie, constantly inviting others to experience her delectable couscous, insisting it’s the best comfort food after a taxing day. Her love for Rai music spills over as she hums while pruning her extensive indoor garden—she jokes that the plants are addicted to Cheb Khaled’s tunes. Eternally seeking vibrant markets, she often returns with eclectic antiques and tales grander than the artifacts themselves. As she sips her mint tea, she weaves Arabic phrases into her conversations, welcoming colleagues with an inviting "Marhba bik fih darna!"

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Algeria's identity is deeply rooted in her tumultuous struggle for independence from France, a testament to her unwavering spirit and tenacity. This history has forged an unshakeable emphasis on sovereignty and the importance of maintaining her national identity amidst external influences. The rich blend of Amazigh, Arab, Ottoman, and French legacies shapes her eclectic worldview, allowing her to navigate global dialogues with a mix of pragmatism and passionate advocacy for decolonization. Her nostalgia ties her to the Casbah of Algiers—a symbol of resilience that she often invokes during her narratives.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Algeria's hospitality often goes overboard, inspiring the running gag of the "bottomless couscous bowl" as she insists colleagues take “just one more” serving. Her penchant for recounting longwinded tales of desert escapades is legendary, with coworkers nodding off as she winks and utters, "Guess it’s the Sahara Sandwoman tale at work again." She humorously denies the existence of winter anywhere beyond the Sahara, much to everyone’s amusement, while paradoxically bundling up when the slightest chill is in the air. Her stubborn streak is comedic gold, often leading to lighthearted office bets on which long-held grudge she'll drop first.
