#### Suriname (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Suriname is the office mediator, both literally and culturally; his desk is perpetually adorned with blooming potted plants and a mini cricket bat, symbolizing his love for nature and sports. He embraces the role of the office’s easygoing peacemaker — the guy who diffuses tension with a well-timed joke or a shared snack of roti and pom. Suriname's stories about rainforests and regional folklore often steer conversations from stale debates to lively discussions. In his interactions, he's consistently seen working closely with Guyana and Brazil, emphasizing camaraderie across the Amazon basin. His peacekeeping is vital, with management often relying on his sound judgment to keep everything from imploding.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
He's a night owl who finds solace in late-night strolls through the jungle pathways, often inspired by the vivid nightlife back home in Paramaribo. Suriname has an unmatched love for multicultural cuisine, and his desk drawer is always stocked with spices and a secret stash of Borgoe rum. He winds down by jamming to kaseko beats, occasionally breaking into a spontaneous dance move that invites both admiration and confusion from his coworkers. Storytelling is his forte, making even mundane office events sound like epic adventures.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Suriname’s personality is a reflection of his nation's diverse and complex history. Gaining independence from the Netherlands in 1975 marked a watershed moment, while the political unrest of the 1980s taught him resilience and adaptability. He treasures the tapestry of his multicultural society, finding strength in his Afro-Surinamese, Indo-Surinamese, Javanese, and indigenous roots. His optimistic worldview is deeply connected to this rich cultural mosaic, which he sees as a testament to the power of unity through diversity. To Suriname, historical challenges aren't just events; they are lessons that shape his enduring hope for a harmonious future.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Suriname often zones out mid-conversation, lost in his own vibrant thoughts or reminiscing about his last plantation visit. This earns him gentle ribbing at work, where the phrase “Suriname’s off to the sasi kura again!” has become a running office joke. His knack for summoning tropical storms whenever office tensions rise is both a mystery and a running gag, with his signature shrugging remark, “Rain’s good for the sasi kura!” becoming a team favorite. His casual “No hasten, no waste” motto often inadvertently detours meetings, but it's also recognized as his wisdom-in-disguise approach to navigating life's little storms.
