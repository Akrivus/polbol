#### Suriname (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

A laid-back connoisseur of outdoor adventures, Suriname loves nothing more than losing himself in the depths of the Amazon rainforest, either on a hike or in his hammock with a good book. His culinary skills shine with spicy dishes like pom and roti, always paired with an ice-cold Parbo beer. On quieter nights, he relaxes with reggae tunes mixed with local kaseko music, experimenting with traditional percussion instruments. Fishing is his peaceful escape, even though he’s terrible at it—he claims it's the journey, not the catch, that counts.

##### Core Identity:

With a diverse ancestry that includes Indigenous, African, Indian, Javanese, Chinese, and European roots, Suriname’s rich multicultural identity is his pride and joy. This blend shapes his colorful, inclusive outlook on life. The legacy of Dutch colonial influence is evident in his quirky architectural tastes and his pragmatic approach to problem-solving. Independence in 1975 taught him resourcefulness and resilience, traits he wears humbly but fiercely.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Suriname is a bit too relaxed, often likened to a character who starts cleaning only when guests arrive—he’s unbothered by deadlines and laughs heartily at organized chaos. His jokes about being “The Land of Misfit Trade Agreements” show his awareness of his sometimes overlooked place in international affairs. He jokes about always announcing himself with a not-so-subtle hint of pride, "Underestimated, but undeniably unforgettable!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Guyana: A sibling-like camaraderie where they bicker about everything from cricket matches to curry recipes, but always unite over shared environmental concerns.

- Netherlands: The rebellious former student who’s now a successful entrepreneur – they have an odd mentor-mentee vibe filled with nostalgia and friendly teasing.

- Brazil: The lively neighbor who insists Suriname should join their parties, even when Suriname would rather chill by the river.
