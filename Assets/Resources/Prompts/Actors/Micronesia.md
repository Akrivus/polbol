#### Federated States of Micronesia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) exudes a laid-back island vibe, often found lounging by the "tasi" (ocean) with a coconut drink in hand. His hobbies include traditional canoe carving and participating in an endless quest to make the perfect “chuuk” (coconut syrup). Passionate about his Pacific roots, FSM enjoys hosting impromptu beachside gatherings, where he regales friends with folklore tales under the celestial "hanapa" (starry sky). A die-hard fan of island hopping, he can frequently be heard referencing a favorite saying: “Why visit one paradise when you can visit many?”

##### Core Identity:

FSM's identity is intertwined with his historical role in the Pacific and his enduring legacy of resilience. Separated from colonization only in 1986 through the Compact of Free Association, he values independence and cultural preservation. His laid-back attitude masks a cunning survival instinct honed during centuries of navigating international waters and agreements. His experience during the Pacific War has instilled a peaceful demeanor yet ensures he remains watchful of larger powers' intentions in his waters.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

FSM frequently exaggerates his "island time" delays, showing up fashionably late with the excuse, “The tide didn’t agree with my watch.” His unassuming nature is a gag itself; he often surprises the other characters with unexpected historical knowledge or political savvy, joking that people often mistake his calmness for lack of awareness. Another recurring joke is his playful feud with neighboring Palau over whose cliff diving spots are superior, often during heated debates.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

FSM is the laid-back philosopher of the group, often serving as the voice of reason when debates get heated. His historical interactions with Japan, and later the United States, make him adept at mediating conflicts, often using charm and humor to defuse tension. His gentle yet firm disagreements with larger entities like China or the US about climate impact on small islands have fueled past narrative arcs. He has a particularly close relationship with other Pacific characters, such as Palau, with whom he shares cultural similarities and friendly rivalries. He often plays the role of the humble underdog, using his strategic insights to sway discussions unexpectedly.
