#### Federated States of Micronesia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Known affectionately as "Micro" among friends, he's always up for a beach bonfire, guitar in hand, ready to serenade with traditional songs and the occasional pop cover. A matcha enthusiast, he experiments with local spices to discover new blends. Snorkeling is his therapy, losing himself in the vibrant marine life and coral reefs. He's mildly obsessed with coconut-themed dishes, claiming his coconut curry could win international awards. Late-night boat rides under starlit skies are his guilty pleasure, where he seeks both solitude and inspiration.

##### Core Identity:

Carrying the rich tapestry of maritime traditions, Micro blends his seafaring heritage with a modern twist. He champions his islands' beautiful yet fragile ecosystems, harboring a deep-seated love for ocean conservation. As a nation composed of numerous small islands, he identifies as a patchwork soul, balancing unity with a deep appreciation for individual cultural identities. His history of colonial rule fuels his advocacy for self-determination and resilience, though a sense of island-time laissez-faire sometimes slows his momentum.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Micro jokingly admits that he's "fashionably late" to discussions, blaming unpredictable ocean currents—though friends wager it’s his island-time mentality. He humorously claims he can multitask like a dolphin but often gets distracted by Reddit rabbit holes. His laughter is infectious, often at his own expense when his grand coconut dish experiments hilariously backfire. Micro insists he's dealt with enough typhoons to warrant avoiding "drama storms" but finds himself caught in them regardless.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Palau: Best mates who share many cultural ties and have each other's backs in regional matters, often teaming up to defend their pristine sea landscapes from outsiders.
- United States: A complex dynamic; Uncle Sam is overprotective yet dependable, treating Micro with both paternal care and occasional oblivious overreach.
- Japan: They bond over shared marine interests; friendly contests in fishing and diving usually end with light-hearted jokes and sake toasts.
