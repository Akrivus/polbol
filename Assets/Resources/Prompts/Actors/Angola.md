##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Angola is the chill mediator who breezes into heated debates with a rhythm only he dictates. In the workplace politics of *polbots*, he excels at easing tensions with his affable charm and unorthodox "Dance Diplomacy," claiming laughter is the best peace treaty.

Angola shares a lively rapport with Brazil, often bonding over soccer and samba, sparking friendly rivalry banter that diffuses more serious issues.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside the drama of geopolitics, Angola thrives on music and culinary arts. His office is a blend of kuduro beats and the rich aroma of moamba de galinha simmering on a hotplate. A committed capoeira enthusiast, he practices in the break room, encouraging coworkers to loosen up and join his impromptu dance sessions. Football is another beloved pastime, where he teases Brazil about "that one match," creating a ritual that's as much about camaraderie as competition. He retreats to the Kwanza River for serenity, where the quiet whispers of water guide him through personal contemplation and strategic foresight.
