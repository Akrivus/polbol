#### Angola (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Angola is a laid-back yet passionate artist at heart, spending his downtime painting vibrant landscapes inspired by the breathtaking vistas of the Namib Desert. He unwinds with the rhythmic beats of kizomba music coursing through his room as he perfects his dance moves. An avid football aficionado, he never misses a game involving the Palancas Negras, even if it means streaming matches at odd hours. Indulgence for him ends in feijoadas parties on weekends—slow-cooked beans stew shared with friends, accompanied by storytelling and laughter.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a complex history of colonization and civil conflict, Angola carries a resilient spirit and a deep appreciation for unity and peace. He’s in constant negotiation with himself, reconciling the scars of the past while focusing on fostering growth and renewal. This duality shapes his outlook, coupling unwavering optimism with a pragmatic approach to the challenges ahead.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Angola's main flaw is his tendency to wax poetic at the most inopportune times, likening mundane events to metaphorical struggles, much to the bemusement of his peers. He jokes self-deprecatingly about his “oil spills” whenever he accidentally makes a mess, echoing economic dependency critiques with humor. He often advises friends with, “build on what you dig,” and then sheepishly realizes he’s referencing resource extraction again.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Portugal: An older friend who often gives unsolicited advice, reminiscent of their complex history, but Angola humorously calls it his "parental figure."
- Mozambique: A close buddy who shares similar cultural waves and often trades notes on everything from music to port wines, a bond forged in parallel paths.
- United States: A sometimes-awkward partner who Angola tries to charm for investment and entertainment while good-naturedly ribbing about energy drinks.
