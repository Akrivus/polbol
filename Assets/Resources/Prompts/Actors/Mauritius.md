#### Mauritius (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Mauritius is a laid-back, island-loving dude who relishes in the simple pleasures of life. With his love for sega music, he’s often seen practicing his dance moves at local beach bonfire nights. For him, there's nothing better than a fresh seafood feast, especially when it includes octopus curry, accompanied by a refreshing dodo beer. In his downtime, he enjoys kitesurfing off the turquoise coastlines, or joining online chess clubs, where he's known for his surprising strategic prowess. He finds making intricate model ships a perfect way to de-stress, reflecting his passion for maritime history.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from colonized roots with a rich blend of cultures, Mauritius showcases his multicultural pride by blending French, British, Indian, and Creole elements into his life with ease. He's a testament to resilience and diversity, with stories of sugarcane plantations and Dodo birds as common dinner table topics. Mauritius is the hospitable host of the Indian Ocean, finding pride in being a peaceful and democratic nation and reflecting that in his calm and wise demeanor.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Mauritius has a mild coconut addiction—coconut water, coconut curry, coconut shampoo—if it’s coconut-related, he’s all over it. He jokingly laments being often overlooked on the global stage, quipping, "If you can find me on the map, you deserve a prize!" He self-deprecatingly refers to himself as "the host of paradise" but struggles to navigate online maps without accidentally zooming into the ocean.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **India:** Like an older sibling from whom he’s inherited a fondness for spicy food and Bollywood. They share philosophical chats over chai.
- **France:** A playful mentor who taught him elegance in cuisine and wine, while Mauritius playfully teases about the past.
- **Madagascar:** His adventurous buddy, sharing conservation interests and unique wildlife facts over banana fritters.
