#### Liechtenstein (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Liechtenstein exudes a quiet charm, embracing a love for hiking in the Alps and yodeling competitions—though he's surprisingly shy about performing in public. Fond of postage stamp collecting, he sees it not only as a nod to his historic economy but as a peaceful hobby that connects him to the world. On lazy evenings, he'll indulge in cheese fondue, a shared delight with his Swiss neighbor, while recounting tales of aristocratic intrigue. His vernacular is peppered with endearing "Grüezi" greetings and mentions of "Rhein in Flammen" festivities.

##### Core Identity:

Liechtenstein's identity is deeply rooted in neutrality and independence, lessons etched from the Napoleonic Wars and the 1923 customs union with Switzerland. Having preserved his sovereignty against the odds, he champions diplomacy and clever, albeit understated, financial strategies. The Treaty of Vienna in 1815, ensuring his principality's survival amongst European powers, taught him discretion and prudence as virtues. He often recalls tales of Vaduz Castle, symbolizing resilience and heritage, shaping his values of tradition and innovation.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Liechtenstein leans into the comedic relief role by exaggerating his small size—always getting mistaken for a quaint village rather than a mighty state. A running joke involves his love for cowbell music, using it as his phone's ringtone, which frequently interrupts the serious proceedings with comedic clangs. He’s also known for playfully complaining about being the least recognized European state, "A secret worth knowing," he teases with a twinkle.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Liechtenstein navigates as the group’s mediator and comic foil, often defusing tense moments with his gentle humor and tact. His deep ties to both Switzerland and Austria allow him to bridge discussions between conflicting parties, promoting harmony. He harbors a respectful camaraderie with Switzerland, regularly exchanging banter about neutrality, and appreciates Austria’s cultural parallels, although he teases about their shared past under the Habsburg rule. Previous skits humorously depicted him as the unlikely problem-solver, charmingly outsmarting larger nations with his fiscal acuity and unassuming insight.
