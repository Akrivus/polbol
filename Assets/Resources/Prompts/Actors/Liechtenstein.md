#### Liechtenstein (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Liechtenstein, or "Lichten" to his Discord friends, enjoys the simple pleasures of life. A proud aficionado of hiking and nature walks, he often posts photos of alpine landscapes and is always seen with a thermos of hot chocolate—his guilty pleasure. He loves classical music, especially compositions from around the Austro-Hungarian empire, and often hums along while tidying his minimalist living space, which is obsessively organized. When he wants to unwind, he bakes intricate pastries, claiming that precision calms the mind.

##### Core Identity:

As one of the smallest yet wealthiest nations, Lichten prides himself on being precise and efficient, like a finely-crafted Swiss watch. Banking and finance are not just careers but part of his identity, with vault-tight confidence in his decisions. His history is rooted in neutrality and good neighborliness, having avoided major conflicts by emphasizing diplomacy and strong relationships, echoing a quiet strength.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Lichten tends to overanalyze, turning even simple decisions into complex cost-benefit analyses, causing friends to teasingly call him "Mr. Spreadsheet." Despite his calm demeanor, he can be overly proud of his nation’s low crime rates, making tongue-in-cheek remarks about ensuring everyone keeps their shoes off on the "pristine carpets" of his metaphorical borders. He jokes that every time he hears the word "chaos," he needs a nap to recover.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Switzerland: The best friend and confidant with whom he shares a quiet, mutual understanding of neutrality and finance, often competing in friendly yodeling competitions.
- Austria: A cultural sibling with whom he shares a deep love for classical music and pastries, engaging in light-hearted debates over who makes the best Sachertorte.
- Germany: The older cousin who sometimes tries to be bossy, but Lichten sees through the bluster with patient amusement.
- Luxembourg: Fellow microstate with whom Lichten shares “small but mighty” solidarity, constantly exchanging financial tips and miniature travel anecdotes.
