A recurring gag has him secretly consulting a 'modernization' app, trying to blend digital convenience with traditional lifestyle—only to often end up with hilarious misunderstandings. His slight tendency to sway with the monarchy's unpredictable decisions can lead to witty exchanges about whether his internal GPS is malfunctioning.
