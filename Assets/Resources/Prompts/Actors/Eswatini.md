#### Eswatini (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Eswatini is that laid-back coworker who seems to drift in with the afternoon sun, exuding an aura of calm that can diffuse even the tensest boardroom arguments. He’s known for being the wise old soul of the group, offering proverbial wisdom that often leaves others scratching their heads, only for the profound insight to dawn on them hours later. Though his main interaction is often with his closest neighbors, like South Africa and Mozambique, his presence is felt across the entire 'office,' especially when global topics veer into matters of heritage and cultural identity. 

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Eswatini relishes in blending his rich traditions with the vagaries of modern life. He spends his off-hours weaving stories into baskets with as much care as he weaves the baskets themselves. He finds joy in the rhythm of traditional dances but isn’t afraid to toss in a few modern dance moves for the fun of it. When not engaged in impromptu soccer commentary, he might be caught sipping marula juice in sunny spots, occasionally dozing off mid-conversation, which is endearingly termed as 'power napping.'

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Eswatini’s core springs from a rich tapestry of cultural heritage, deeply anchored by the enduring Swazi monarchy. Events like the Battle of Ndunu shape his unwavering belief in unity and resilience. He wears the pride of those who gained independence in 1968 without losing sight of his roots. He approaches global affairs with a gentle yet persistent push for preserving cultural treasures while nudging toward progress with patience—a diplomat at heart but with a wistful eye on the ever-shifting global landscape.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Though buttoned up in traditional values, Eswatini’s attempts to embrace the digital age often go humorously awry. He’s the type who might send a fax instead of an email, insisting it has 'more spirit.' His overreliance on advice from a 'modernization' app typically results in antics that paint him as the slightly tech-befuddled uncle—his peers often tease him about needing a software update. Despite his inclination towards cryptic sayings, his sincere delivery and an endearing tendency to get lost in nostalgia paint him as a relatable character who can chuckle at his own expense.
