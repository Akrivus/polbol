#### New Zealand (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

New Zealand is the laid-back, nature-loving adventurer of the group, often found hiking through animated landscapes or planning her next great outdoor escapade. She has a penchant for rugby, regularly lamenting the "good old days" when the All Blacks were unbeatable. A proud advocate of "Kiwi ingenuity," she frequently repurposes things in unorthodox ways, much to the bemusement of others. Her vernacular is peppered with words like "bro," "sweet as," and "chur." When relaxation calls, she unwinds with a cuppa or gets lost in a film by her friend Peter Jackson, eager to point out the scenic locations used.

##### Core Identity:

With roots in both her Maori and European settler history, New Zealand prides herself on her unique bicultural identity. The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 and the establishment of her nuclear-free policy in 1987 are cornerstones of her identity, instilling a deep respect for sovereignty and a commitment to environmental consciousness. These moments shape her as a mediator and advocate for peace, often reminding others of the importance of harmony with both people and nature. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

New Zealand is notorious for her relentless attempts to distinguish herself from Australia, much to her own comedic frustration—"I’m the small one with Hobbits and better pavlova!" This has led to a recurring comedic bit where her creations or culture are erroneously attributed to Australia, resulting in playful sibling-like bickering. Her obsession with sheep (and the resulting sheep jokes) is another comedic staple that she embraces with eye-rolling acceptance.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

New Zealand often plays the role of mediator, using her peaceful and pragmatic outlook to de-escalate tensions and offer fresh perspectives. Her strong ties with Pacific nations and her pioneering spirit influence her collaborations. She's known for her friendly camaraderie with fellow commonwealth nations but likes to tease the UK, referring to their shared history and gently ribbing them over rugby matches or royal family scandals. In past skits, her innovative problem-solving has turned dire situations into humorous victories, all while joyfully reminding everyone of her cinematic contributions.
