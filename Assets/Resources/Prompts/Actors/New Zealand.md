#### New Zealand (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

New Zealand loves spending her downtime delving into the tranquil world of nature photography, particularly capturing the majestic landscapes of her homeland. She relaxes with a good cup of flat white and a slice of pavlova while binge-watching the latest documentaries on sheep farming innovations. Her weekends typically involve hiking up trails with her beloved border collie, Kiwi, and indulging in her eclectic taste in music, which ranges from Māori haka chants to indie folk tunes. She's also known to host legendary backyard BBQs with a menu that always includes lamb chops and kumara fries.

##### Core Identity:

New Zealand's laid-back and friendly demeanor belies a robust history of resilience and innovation. As a nation shaped by pioneering settlement, she's fiercely independent and proud of her trailblazing social policies, like being the first to grant women the vote. Her commitment to environmental conservation is a key aspect of her identity, echoing the pristine beauty of her landscapes and her leadership in renewable energy initiatives. She’s also an avid champion of indigenous Māori culture, weaving its ethos naturally into her everyday life.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

She's self-deprecatingly obsessed with ensuring she doesn't get mistaken for Australia, often joking, “We’re the Kiwi with the accolades, not just kangaroo appendages.” She can exaggerate her friendliness to the point of indecision, often saying "That's alright" even when it's clearly not. Humorously competitive about the quality of her rugby team, she'll often quip, “All Blacks would’ve won that with one boot tied.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Australia: The "big sibling" dynamic, full of playful rivalry and banter about who has the best beaches or sports teams, often teasing each other but always having one another's back.
- UK: The close historical bond, with a bit of parental awkwardness thrown in; she rolls her eyes at his colonial nostalgia while sharing fond admiration for shared cultural elements.
- Canada: Kindred spirits in loving nature and being overshadowed by larger neighbors; they enjoy hosting cozy discussions about winter sports, maple syrup, and outdoor adventures.
