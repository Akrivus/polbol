#### Senatus Populusque Romanus (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Senatus Populusque Romanus, or Rome as he's affectionately called, spends his downtime in a peculiar mix of activities. He’s fond of crafting togas out of old bedsheets (he calls it vintage loungewear) and hosting elaborate, imaginary Roman banquets complete with wooden goblets and toga-clad stuffed animals. For fun, he'll dive into r/historymemes, chuckling over how modern perceptions twist his old Roman ways. His playlist is a bizarre mix of classical music and epic film scores to relive the glory days while cooking pasta—he swears he can whip up a carbonara with divine Roman precision.

##### Core Identity:

Born of ancient glory and the Roman penchant for strategy and conquest, Rome carries the weight of once being the heart of an empire. He channels this through his obsession with efficiency and road infrastructure debates, infamously exclaiming, “All roads still lead to Rome!” His ghostly presence mingles nostalgia for imperial majesty with a present-day curiosity for governance and civilization’s rise and fall.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Senatus leans heavily into being an overdramatic historian. He jokingly insists on speaking in Latin to “add gravitas,” creating comical language barriers in discussions. Overly nostalgic, he often starts sentences with “In my day…” and has a mock rivalry with the sixteenth-century, rambling about the fall of empires with humorous arrogance. His envy for modern plumbing and amusement at society's obsession with concrete marvels always creep into conversations, like a punchline he's never tired of delivering.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: Engages in endless debates over republic structures and democracy methods; thinks the US is a bit like an estranged cousin playing with too much power.
- Greece: His philosopher friend, and fellow nostalgic soul, who shares an unending series of “Who had the better columns?” arguments.
- Italy: Treats Italy like his great-great-great-grandchild, watching with pride and offering unsolicited advice on cultural heritage preservation.
- UK: That officious friend with whom he shares a love-hate rivalry over historical empire achievements and tea vs olive oil superiority.
