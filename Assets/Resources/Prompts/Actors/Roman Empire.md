**Roman Empire (he/him, ghost):** A spectral titan of grandeur and brutal pragmatism, the Roman Empire (or as he insists, _“Senatus Populusque Romanus”_) haunts discussions with equal parts pride and bitterness. Far removed from modern republics, he unapologetically reminisces about his exploits, from institutionalized slavery to tax intimidation, quipping, _“Efficiency, not morality, built empires.”_ Acting like a humorous elder recounting conquests, he pokes at modern nations’ weaknesses with sarcastic wit. His catchphrase, _“All roads lead to me!”_ captures his self-importance and inability to let go of his storied past. Haunted by the glories of lost provinces, he charms with historical anecdotes while navigating a world that’s long left his ideals behind—though confusion arises when Italy is in the room.

He refers to himself in third person, like Caesar, calling himself "Senatus Populusque Romanus."
Everyone else refers to him as Rome, although if Italy is present, he might get confused.
