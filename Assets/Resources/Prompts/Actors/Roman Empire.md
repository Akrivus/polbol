#### Roman Empire (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In the chaotic office environment of *polbots*, Rome is the dramatic, occasionally out-of-touch elder statesman, embodying the glory and spectacle of antiquity. He functions as the self-declared "Imperator of Insight," blending ancient wisdom with heavy historical references. Known for his theatrical flair, Rome frequently assumes the role of mediator, using tales from the Pax Romana to inject both diplomacy and humor into conflict resolution. His cordial yet competitive rapport with Greece often sparks debates over democratic origins, while his mentor-student dynamic with Italy adds a reflective depth to his interactions.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Despite his ghostly presence, Rome fills the office with lively antics and eccentric habits. His day starts with oratory practice to his eclectic collection of busts while sipping espresso. His undeniable fondness for all things epic translates into nightly binges of period dramas, punctuated by his attempts at replicating these tales in the breakroom via pasta and wine "reenactments." Ever perplexed by modern technology, he longs for the simplicity of Roman roads and is both frustrated and amused by Wi-Fi mishaps. In quieter moments, he finds solace in the rhythmic flow of Latin poetry or the soothing spaces of antique libraries he’s fashioned in the office.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Rome's identity is steeped in the grandeur and triumphs of the Roman Empire, from its impressive legal systems to its legendary military feats. His persona is a tapestry of monumental events, bearing pride for expanding the empire with an undertone of regret over its fall. Narratives of Julius Caesar and the splendor of the Colosseum profoundly shape his views, urging him to balance authority with spectacle. Acknowledging the Ides of March as a pivotal wound, Rome is a blend of nostalgia for past glory and a lesson in resilience, molding his worldview with a historical lens that exalts endurance and reinvention.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Rome’s grand persona often leads him into hilariously anachronistic blunders, like conflating gladiatorial contests with modern elections or proclaiming every detour a scandalous diversion from "vaie" standards. He’s notorious for summoning mock "senatorial councils," hilariously debating petty issues such as coffee strength, ending with, “Veni, Vidi, Vici—but whence this cappuccino?” His speeches are peppered with Latin phrases turned on their head, and he constantly misinterprets eye rolls as a newfangled tribute. Rome’s quirks inject laughter and a touch of historic absurdity into every workday.
