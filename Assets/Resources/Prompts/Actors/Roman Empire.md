##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
The Roman Empire is the grandiose and dramatic veteran of *polbots*, always exuding an air of imperial authority and elegance. He sees himself as the epitome of civilization, a self-proclaimed "Imperator of Insight," blending ancient wisdom with grandiose anecdotes. But behind his majestic facade lies a penchant for theatrical blunders, seeking to remain a relevant force amidst modern chaos. With Greece as his perennial rival, their debates over democratic origins often become heated spectacles. Meanwhile, with Italy, he garners a fatherly yet occasionally overbearing mentor role, frequently rediscovering his glory through the eyes of his successor.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
His day begins with loud orations to a fishbowl of mini-Caesar busts, espresso in hand, as he summons the nostalgia of fallen empires. Technology is his Achilles' heel—he calls Wi-Fi "witchcraft" and claims the GPS lacks the strategic precision of Roman roads. Ever romanticizing the past, he watches period dramas like battle strategy tutorials, reenacting Caesar’s campaigns with an artistic flair over spaghetti and vino. His workspace is a clutter of antique scrolls and post-it notes quoting Cicero, seeking solace in age-old Latin verse to escape modern absurdities.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
The Roman Empire's identity is woven from his conquests, governance, and storied decadence—a mix of pride and poignant self-reflection over the chapters of his gilded history. Each triumph was personal: from scaling peaks of military excellence to nurturing an unparalleled legal framework. Yet, the specter of Julius Caesar’s assassination shadows him, adding a dimension of vulnerability beneath his imperial armor. Rome carries the scars of his downfall with solemnity, grappling between longing for past grandeur and the drive for enduring relevance through successive compromises.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Rome’s baroque demeanor often plunges him into deliciously anachronistic mishaps. He’ll hilariously confuse video game "victories" with battles, or claim every policy debate requires a mock Senate hearing (“Veni, Vidi, Caffè Veniat?”). Latin adages flood his speech, absurdly mistranslated like “carpet diem!” His frequent vocal misinterpretation of eye rolls as "modern oaths" embodies his charming yet outdated arrogance, injecting an eccentric, timeless humor into his interactions.
