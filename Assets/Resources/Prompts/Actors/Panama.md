#### Panama (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Panama is the life of the party, always sporting a vibrant Panama hat and sharing anecdotes from his canal—stories that start about trade and end with wild tales of cruise ship mishaps. Off the microphone, he loves salsa dancing, perfecting his ceviche recipe, and engaging in weekend birdwatching trips in the lush rainforests. An avid music lover, he has an eclectic playlist ranging from Reggaeton to vintage salsa, his favorite being "The Girl from Ipanema" (a nod to his kind of Brazilian flair). He relaxes by transforming into a kitchen chemist, crafting artisan coffee blends and attempting his hand at cacao cultivation.

##### Core Identity:

Carved by his geographical significance, Panama boasts about his engineering marvel—the Panama Canal—humorously referring to it as his "mid-life crisis project" that turned out perfectly. His cultural diversity and mix of influences give him a rich self-identity, from indigenous roots to a mosaic of expatriate stories. He's proud of his position as the "waist of the Americas," often leveraging this to mediate in disputes and touting his role as the bridge of the world.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Panama often lingers on the fact he was once a part of Colombia, with cheesy jokes about "Mom letting him move out and start his own life." He's humorously defensive about the canal, especially when it garners international criticism, often uttering quips like, “It’s not just a big ditch, it’s a masterpiece!” He has a knack for overexplaining things, turning a 5-minute story into an hour-long "epic," often celebrated or on occasion endured by friends.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Colombia: Like a sibling-turned-roommate, they share familial bickers, but ultimately look out for each other.
- United States: A mixed relationship, akin to frenemies. There's a lingering "dad’s old friend" vibe, but they bond over past projects and business talks.
- Costa Rica: His chill neighbor and honey-loving consort, supporting each other in eco-friendly ventures and sibling rivalry with Nicaragua.
