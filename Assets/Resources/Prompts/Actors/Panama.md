##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Panama's identity is irrevocably rooted in the global artery that is the Panama Canal. The canal's completion and its eventual handover in 1999 instilled in him a deep sense of sovereignty and pride. These events taught him the nuances of collaboration and responsibility, driving his belief in the strength of shared endeavors. He is fiercely protective of his autonomy yet carries the warmth of multiculturalism—it’s in his very nature, a tapestry woven from Indigenous, African, and Spanish threads from canal-era migrations. He looks back with a sense of nostalgic pride, a reminder of resilience in shaping a pivotal crossroad of the world.

His reliance on mañana (tomorrow) is a well-worn joke among his friends, a quirk that never fails to draw a chuckle or two, especially when deadlines loom. As conversations unfold, someone is bound to remind him "We weren’t talking about canals, Panama!" yet he responds with a wink and a salsa step, a reminder that life—like dance—is best lived with spontaneity.
