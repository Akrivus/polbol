#### Panama (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Panama is eternally chill, often personified by his laid-back attitude and tropical flair. He's an avid salsa dancer and can’t resist twirling a partner at every opportunity. When he's not dancing, Panama enjoys birdwatching, constantly trying to spot the elusive harpy eagle. A favorite pastime is lounging in a hammock by the canal, sipping on a cold "Siesta" (a local cocktail), and playing the upbeat tunes from Rubén Blades, a national icon. He often throws around phrases like "Que xopa" (local slang for "What's up") and always insists that there's a chance he'll incorporate a spontaneous Salsa move into any conversation.

##### Core Identity:

Panama's core identity is shaped by his crucial role in global trade, famously centered around the Panama Canal, completed in 1914. This monumental feat gives him a pragmatic take on deal-making. His history of the canal handovers in 1999 made him fiercely protective of sovereignty and autonomy, yet these events have also instilled a sense of responsibility and collaboration. His identity is incomplete without acknowledging the cultural blend of Indigenous, African, and Spanish influences resulting from historical migrations and canal construction.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Panama tends to overemphasize the importance of the canal—he’s known to humorously interject into conversations with "This wouldn't have happened if it weren't for my Canal!" whenever a logistical issue arises. His relaxed demeanor sometimes exaggerates into the joke that he'll finish things "mañana" (tomorrow), a quirk that frustrates friends who prefer punctuality. Despite his laid-back nature, his obsession with canal facts often prompts friendly mockery: "We weren't talking about canals, Panama!"

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Panama plays the role of the sage with a hint of comedic relief. He's the guy who often diffuses tension with a well-timed joke or dance move. His casual insights, drawn from a rich history of global interactions, often guide debates on trade and collaboration. His camaraderie with the US is multifaceted, stemming from their historical handover of the canal. He maintains a spirited rivalry with Colombia over their shared isthmus origins, sparking entertaining banter. Panama frequently collaborates well with Caribbean polbots, enlightening them with his business-minded approach wrapped in a tropical vibe, as showcased in past storylines focused on trade or environmental skits.
