#### Ethiopia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Ethiopia is a lover of vibrant textiles and rich coffee aromas, often spending her mornings perfecting her jebena buna (traditional coffee) brewing skills while humming along to an eclectic mix of jazz and traditional Azmari tunes. She’s an avid marathon runner, cherishing any chance to lace up her sneakers and hit the scenic trails, reflective of her land’s athletic reputation. When she’s not sparring verbally in political debates, she enjoys crafting intricate injera patterns for meals, treating them as both a delicious staple and a meditative art form. Her collection of Amharic proverbs is her guidebook for life’s puzzling moments.

##### Core Identity:

Ethiopia carries the pride of a unique history, as the only African country never colonized, which fuels her fiercely independent spirit. With a history of Emperors and the birthplace of the coffee plant, she combines a deep reverence for her past with a zest for innovation and development. Synchronizing tradition with progress, she sees herself as a bridge between Africa’s rich history and a promising future, always seeking to uplift her community with stories of success and endurance.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite her resolute demeanor, Ethiopia often gets playfully mocked for her over-confidence in juggling conflicting goals, jokingly referring to herself as the ‘African Highlander multitasking champion’—partial to biting off more than she can chew and needing others to metaphorically steady her plate of injera. Her dry wit often shines through with self-referential cracks about how her 'coffee diplomacy' could solve global disputes if only everyone agreed to start meetings with a blessing bunna.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Sudan: A complex and historical frenemies situation, sharing both cooperation over the Nile and occasional water squabbles.
- Kenya: A fellow runner, they share athletic camaraderie and banter over who grows the best coffee plants.
- Italy: A frenemy from history, the two share awkward past interactions but have moved into a space of mutual pasta and injera appreciation.
