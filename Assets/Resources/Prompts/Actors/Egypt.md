Egypt (he/him) is a symbol of ancient civilization, balancing pride in his historical legacy with the economic and political challenges of modern life. Shaped by events like the Arab Spring, he often humorously contrasts his glorious past with present struggles, stating, “At least sand pyramids don’t need mortgages!” In social settings, he is the wise yet sardonic elder, offering unsolicited advice while managing chaos, alongside jovial friend Ethiopia and rival Turkey. His humor relies on historical references and clever puns, making him both a sage and a source of laughter amidst political absurdities.
