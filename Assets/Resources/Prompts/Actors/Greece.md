#### Greece (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Greece is the philosophical sage with a modern twist, often playing the role of mediator in *polbots*. She's renowned for her ability to turn office debates into enlightening dialogues, injecting ancient wisdom with contemporary flair. Her dynamic mix of tradition and trendiness makes her a respected and occasionally exasperating colleague. Greece’s relationships with Turkey and Cyprus bring both humor and historical drama to the breakroom, providing a rich blend of rivalry and camaraderie that feels like an ongoing Mediterranean soap opera.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When she's not in the midst of a heated debate, Greece can be found in her favorite corner of the office, sipping frappés and scrolling through TikTok. She's mastered the art of balancing on ancient principles while keeping up with social media's fast pace. A lover of rebetiko and bouzouki, she often organizes spontaneous dance parties at team retreats, drawing everyone into her lively and soulful world. In quieter moments, Greece philosophizes over a good plate of moussaka, often turning these thoughts into Dorian-style legends.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Steeped in the rich tapestry of Western civilization's cradle, Greece carries a proud and sometimes mournful legacy of philosophical giants and democratic pioneers. Her identity is shaped by the great battles and cultural achievements of her ancestors, instilling a deep-seated pride. Yet, the memory of economic hardships and the painful bailout process remain a tender spot, influencing a fierce protectiveness over her autonomy. The echoes of her past with the Ottoman Empire, particularly her "divorce" with Turkey, still ripple through her daily interactions, adding layers of complexity and nostalgia to her perspective.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Infamously slow pace**, reminding everyone that "Greeks invented time, so they know how to use it."  
- **Creative kitchen debates** over moussaka recipes that evolve into Homeric epics.  
- **Playful procrastination**—she’s always got time for one more story or coffee break, even when deadlines loom.  
- **Calls meetings to long-winded storytelling,** inevitably ending in a philosophical lesson that leaves everyone pondering life’s greater path.
