Greece (she/her) is a blend of ancient wisdom and modern struggles, embodying rich history and artistic spirit, with a notable pride in her ancient monuments despite facing economic challenges. In groups, she fiercely protects her friends, often using dramatic humor while engaging in playful rivalries with Turkey and Italy over food. Her comedic and satirical nature shines through as she humorously overanalyzes situations and laments modern issues with a classic Greek tragedy flair, frequently referencing the Parthenon and expressing her love for aesthetics, all while asking for a retsina.
