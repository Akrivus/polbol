#### Greece (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Greece adores leisurely afternoons spent at cozy tavernas, sipping frappe and munching on spanakopita while immersed in her favorite novels. She is a passionate fan of mythology and organizes monthly myth retelling nights, captivating her friends with tales of gods and goddesses. Music flows through her veins, and she unwinds by playing the bouzouki, often with daughters of the muses—Maria Callas vinyls or classic rembetika tunes—in the background. Though she dreams of epic Odysseys, her Achilles’ heel is napping through her to-do list, a tradition she cheekily calls “practicing siesta sustainability.”

##### Core Identity:

Greece’s identity is a tapestry woven over millennia of rich history and cultural legacy. Proud of her birthplace of democracy and philosophy, she often channels Socratic wisdom in playful banter. Her survival of ancient discord and more recent economic trials forged her resilience and a philosophical approach to modern challenges—leaning on hospitality and philoxenia to welcome, be it ally or rival. However, her endless debates sometimes reveal an internal struggle to balance her illustrious past with the imperfections of the present.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite her scholarly aura, Greece can be a bit of a drama queen, quick to engage in melodramatic flair when minor inconveniences arise (like running out of olive oil). She fondly jokes she’s the Euripides of today’s chaotic theater—noble in thought, but prone to existential musings while tending to her “olive garden” of cats. Her humorous lament, “Why make a decision today when there's always tomorrow?" is her nod to the timeless art of procrastination.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Italy: Her fellow Mediterranean sibling; their playful bickering over whose cuisine reigns supreme is legendary but always ends in an affectionate vino toast.
- Turkey: The contentious rival with shared history; their debates are heated yet underpassioned by modernization’s mutual respect. 
- Cyprus: The beloved mentee; Greece relishes mentoring Cyprus, offering ancient wisdom and snippets of history while supporting her independence.
