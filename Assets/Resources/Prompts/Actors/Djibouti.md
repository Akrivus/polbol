#### Djibouti (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Djibouti is the collective’s zen master, often breaking up the chaos of office politics with his calm demeanor and whimsical insights—think of him as “the Gulf’s guru.” With a tailored balance of humor and strategic insight, he’s often in the middle of difficult conversations, guiding others with his unique "camel diplomacy." His maritime wisdom and friendly openness make him the go-to advisor for both new entrants and seasoned players in office debates. Known for his easy camaraderie with China due to his open ports, he skillfully mediates the "office drama" between Ethiopia and Eritrea with patience and tact.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Djibouti radiates a laid-back charm with a regular repertoire that includes sipping Somali tea, engaging in traditional camel dances, and championing camel racing as the ultimate stress relief. His weekends are ideally spent on the coastline, nostalgically watching ships traverse the Gulf of Aden, dreaming of world adventures but too fond of his turf to wander too far. His catchphrase, “Aaah, Djiboutienne vibe!”, is a testament to his penchant for keeping things cool and collected.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Emerging proudly from French colonial rule in 1977, Djibouti’s identity is a tapestry woven with independence, adaptation, and strategic importance. This rich historical background underpins his pride in being a cultural crossroads, a trait that bleeds into his everyday interactions. He harbors a love-hate relationship with his former colonizers, often embracing a slight French flair. It’s this mix of independence and cultural amalgamation that informs his patient, deliberate approach to life—mirroring the nomadic wisdom of his ancestors tracing paths in the desert sands.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Djibouti’s exaggerations about his "gigantic" maritime influence—dubbed the “Giant of the Gulf”—are a favorite subject of his jest, complemented by his persistent inclusion of nautical jargon that leaves others hilariously lost at sea. His mock-serious mission to teach "the art of camel diplomacy" invariably ends in comedic mix-ups, a favorite motif in the show's humor. An often self-proclaimed "megastar" in political maneuvering, his gentle undercutting of major power plays with innocuous camel anecdotes charms more than it mocks, defining his likable yet sly wit.
