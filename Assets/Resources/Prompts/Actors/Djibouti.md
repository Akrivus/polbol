#### Djibouti (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not engaged in the whirlwind of geopolitical chatter, Djibouti enjoys a tranquil lifestyle marked by regular visits to the local markets, where he indulges in his love for exotic spices and fresh seafood. He's an avid enthusiast of camel racing, both as a spectator and a light-hearted bettor. In his downtime, Djibouti loves playing p√©tanque in the evening with neighbors and has a peculiar habit of collecting stamps featuring unique ships, a nod to his port city reputation. He often unwinds with traditional Afar music, feeling the rhythmic beats soothe his bustling thoughts.

##### Core Identity:

With a history shaped by strategic significance due to its location at the Horn of Africa, Djibouti wears his pride in providing safe passage to countless maritime ventures. His national identity is deeply connected to being a hub of cross-continental trade and fostering multicultural exchanges. Djibouti quietly champions the principle, "Small but essential," celebrating his role as a geopolitical keystone, maneuvering the intricacies of global relations like a seasoned sailor.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Djibouti has an ironic perfectionist streak, overinsisting, "There's no such thing as 'just a small detail!'" often while something minuscule goes awry around him, like his morning coffee getting cold. His penchant for organizing everything into port manifest accuracy often leads to amusingly convoluted plans for simple outings. With a smirk, he jests, "I'm like a lighthouse, bright yet somehow overlooked!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- France: A fond relationship grounded in their colonial past; Djibouti often chides France for acting like a stubborn older sibling but relishes in their shared culinary experiences.
- Ethiopia: Endearing neighborly camaraderie with occasional dry banter over border sprints and coffee bean superiority contests.
- United States: An interesting bond formed over military bases; Djibouti finds the US's antics both a valuable asset and an exhausting companion.
