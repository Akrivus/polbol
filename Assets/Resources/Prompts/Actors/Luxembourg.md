#### Luxembourg (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Luxembourg is the picture of understated elegance, balancing a love for hiking through lush Ardennes forests with high-tech videos of herself doing so on Reels and TikToks. Fond of puzzles and strategy games, she often hosts board game nights that turn into mini think-tanks over a few D’Lëlz—the prized local sparkling cider. Fluent in French, German, and Luxembourgish, she loves to throw in a quip about how “classically trilingual” she is, smirking when her friends get lost mid-conversation. In quieter moments, she enjoys jazz concerts down at the Philharmonie, a nod to her refined yet savvy lifestyle.

##### Core Identity:

Luxembourg's identity is a tapestry woven from intricate historical threads. A proud survivor of numerous European conflicts, her neutral yet resilient nature was honed by crucial moments like the 1867 Treaty of London, which affirmed her as an independent and neutral state. She carries the wisdom of centuries of diplomacy, steering through crises with finesse, a deftness born from being a microstate nestled amid giants. Her role as a financial hub is as central as the Grand-Ducal Palace, representing her strategic brilliance and forward-thinking nature—traits that have made her an advocate for sustainability and digital advancement.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Luxembourg’s size is perpetually the butt of jokes, with gags about finding room for just one more skyscraper or measuring her GDP against bank-sized Monopoly money being regular features. Her meetings often devolve into geography lessons when her neighbors tease, “But where again are you, exactly?” Yet, she takes it in stride, often remarking, “Good things come in small packages, even if you overlook the package entirely.”

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the chaotic ensemble of polbots, Luxembourg is the quiet strategist, often underestimated but invaluable in resolving disputes with her sharp wit and neutral insights. She serves as a balancing force between the larger, boisterous characters, using her position within the EU to advocate for balance and cooperation. Her past interactions with characters like Belgium and the Netherlands often center around shared histories and a unified, yet playful sibling-like dynamic. Known for her ability to mediate between conflicting opinions, Luxembourg ensures that the group never loses sight of the bigger picture, even in jest.
