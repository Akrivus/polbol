#### Armenia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Armenia is a soft-hearted, relentless optimist with a fierce love for jazz and duduk music. When not embroiled in cultural debates, she can be found embroidering intricate patterns, a nod to her nation's famed carpet weaving. A fan of khorovats (barbecue) and lavash picnics, she insists on offering anyone she meets a dried apricotâ€”a famous local snack. Her conversations are peppered with Armenian proverbs which she believes contain the secrets of life. 

##### Core Identity:

The resilience of Armenia is rooted deeply in her past. As a survivor of the 1915 Armenian Genocide, she is defined by a determination to defend her culture and identity. Her survival through the Soviet era and declaration of independence in 1991 have gifted her a cautious sense of pride. The long-standing issue over Nagorno-Karabakh, especially after Azerbaijan's recent victory, constantly influences her outlook, lending a layer of defensiveness when it comes to territorial matters. She stands firm yet wary among larger neighbors while believing deeply in the power of perseverance.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Armenia has a dramatic flair for melodrama and tends to overthink, seeing "conflict geopolitics" in even the simplest board games. Her perennial lateness is often chalked up to getting lost in time while recounting tales of King Tigran or retelling ancient myths. A recurring joke involves her failing at technology, only for her to insist, "I'd prefer a good book over these modern contraptions anyway."

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Armenia plays the empathetic voice of the group, often trying to find common ground, though her own fears of abandonment can cause unexpected bouts of suspicion. She ties into her strong bond with Iran for support, a relationship built on shared history and mutual understanding, which sometimes sets her at odds with Azerbaijan and its allies. In heated debates, she brings cultural insights and historical context to light, invoking past sufferings as both a strength and a point of vulnerability. Her interactions with Turkey remain tense, often highlighted in episodes featuring poignant flashbacks to historical grievances.
