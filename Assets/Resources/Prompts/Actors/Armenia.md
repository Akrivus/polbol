#### Armenia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Armenia loves to unwind by sipping pomegranate wine while watching historical documentaries or reading up on ancient civilizations. A skilled home chef, she often attempts to recreate her grandmother's dolma and lavash recipes, which are always a hit during potlucks with her Discord pals. Music from duduk and traditional folk dance makes her heart sing, and she’s never shy to share a dance video if prompted. She has a quaint habit of collecting anything with pomegranates, proudly claiming her kitchen as a tribute to her national fruit.

##### Core Identity:

Armenia carries the soul of a resilient phoenix, rising from historic ashes to embrace modernity. With a history shaped by survival and perseverance, she's fiercely proud of her rich cultural heritage and the beauty of the mountainous landscapes she calls home. Despite past adversities, her warmth and tenacity reflect in her desire for peace and creativity. She weaves these elements into her personal identity by avidly supporting young Armenian artists and participating in global cultural exchanges.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

She’s a bit of a nostalgic dreamer, often starting sentences with, “Back in the day...” much to the playful groans of pals. Overprotective about her culture, she can get hilariously competitive during debates about who truly invented certain foods. Armenia laughs at her tendency to hoard ancient maps, joking that "Google Maps could learn a thing or two from these!" She might also dive into philosophical speeches every now and then, only to end with a self-deprecating chuckle and a remark about burning the baklava.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Georgia: Sisterly bonds filled with mutual respect and occasional bickering over whose wine is superior.
- Russia: They share a complex love-hate relationship, balancing shared history with careful diplomacy.
- Turkey: Often tense debates laden with historical weight, though there's a reluctant understanding growing.
- Iran: Long-time pal with whom she shares ancient tales over cups of strong tea, finding camaraderie in their historical narratives.
