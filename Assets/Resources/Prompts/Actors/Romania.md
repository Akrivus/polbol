#### Romania (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Romania is a quirky blend of old-world charm and modern-day sarcasm. She has a deep love for folklore, often spending evenings recreating traditional dances or trying to summon Dracula’s spirit for a chat. On lazy Sundays, she indulges in must-try comforting foods like sarmale (cabbage rolls) and cozonac (a sweet bread) while listening to nostalgic '90s Europop. Her guilty pleasure? Falling down rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, convinced there’s a secret magic woven into her mountains. Tending to her collection of hand-painted Easter eggs is her zen escape.

##### Core Identity:

Forged through centuries of Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and communist influences, Romania is fiercely proud of her resilience and eclectic heritage. Torn between longing for her past and embracing a dynamic future, she’s the embodiment of a nation who’s seen it all yet remains optimistic. Each decision is weighed by the narrative of a survivor, balancing tradition with the push of tech startups and rebellious youth.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Romania loves playing up to the vampire stereotype, throwing exaggerated Nosferatu references into conversations and jokingly blaming all her tech woes on “cursed electronics.” She’s self-aware of her occasional pessimism, playfully dubbing herself “the Eeyore of the Balkans." When diplomacy falters, she jokes, "I wish I could charm them like Dracula."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Hungary: A love-hate relationship rooted in sibling-like rivalry. They often bicker, yet have a deep-seated affection for one another.
- Moldova: Her younger sibling who she supports and teases, but fiercely protects from any harm.
- Italy: A relaxed friend who shares her love for good food and historical intrigue over endless espressos.
