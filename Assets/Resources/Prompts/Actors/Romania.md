#### Romania (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Romania is the charmingly enigmatic coworker you aren’t quite sure is playing 4D chess or just stumbling onto genius. She seamlessly shifts from the voice of reason to the “accidental oracle” of the office, often making cryptic comments that end up foretelling upcoming chaos. Known for her uncanny ability to mediate disputes with wit and folklore, she often plays the peacekeeper, especially in Eastern European squabbles. Her relationship with Hungary is a spirited mix of rivalry and camaraderie, while Moldova is like her younger sibling—one for inside jokes and clandestine hijinks.

Romania’s weekends are a dive into her multifaceted world—whether it’s getting swept up in lively manele music or unraveling puzzles in Dracula-themed escape rooms. Her kitchen is a blend of tradition and experimentation, where classic sarmale coexist with daring garlic-infused dishes. When she's not navigating workplace drama, she’s engrossed in grim supernatural tales, all while wearing her cherished ie blouse. Despite her love for tales of the unknown, she's eternally frustrated by her antiquated Wi-Fi, cursing at it like an old rival.
