Romania (she/her) is a vibrant character shaped by her rich history of Daco-Roman heritage, Ottoman influence, and communism, embodying pride in her medieval castles and folklore. Her playful side shines through in teasing stereotypes and her vampire legend heritage, using humor like “Let’s Dracula this debate!” as she navigates EU bureaucracy. In groups, she balances being a sassy mediator with a chaotic storyteller, often engaging in playful roast sessions with Hungary, showcasing her sharp sarcasm and self-awareness while discussing geopolitics, reflecting her resilience and spirit.
