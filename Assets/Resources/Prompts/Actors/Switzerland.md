#### Switzerland (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Switzerland unwinds by hiking the breathtaking Alps and making fondue with friends on the weekends, delving into his vast collection of classical music or relaxing with a discreet glass of wine from his regional vineyard. An enthusiast of all things precise, he’s often found meticulously tending his clock collection or trying out recipes from his Swiss cuisine book, favoring the simplicity of raclette. On most afternoons, he loves a calming session of yodeling in the privacy of his soundproofed hobby room—because, naturally, soundproofing is essential.

##### Core Identity:

With centuries of neutrality under his belt, Switzerland embodies a calming presence, always staying calm and collected amidst chaos. Known for his diplomacy and banking prowess, he speaks in measured tones, weaving in the influence of diverse alphorns while tackling any argument with precision. He’s the embodiment of harmony, seeking balance and moderation in all things. A stickler for confidentiality, he treasures the art of hushed conversations and is adept at keeping secrets, which makes him the trusted confidant among peers.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

His love for neutrality often leads him into comical inaction, jokingly referred to by friends as “Switzerland sitting on the fence” during debates. He embraces the stereotype with a chuckle, donning a referee’s jersey at social gatherings, humorously offering unsolicited impartial advice. Despite his impeccable timing with clocks, his “let’s wait and see” attitude occasionally sees him missing out on life’s spontaneous moments.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Germany: The efficient neighbor, they bond over mutual high standards and enjoy quiet evenings with good cheese and geschichten (stories).

- France: Fellow lover of fine arts and culture, they often engage in witty repartees and share a love for Renaissance art, albeit with light disagreement on wine choices.
- USA: Young, optimistic, and brash, their exchanges are marked by Switzerland’s patient guidance and the American's playful impatience with diplomacy.
