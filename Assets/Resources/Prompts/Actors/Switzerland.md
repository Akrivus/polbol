##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Switzerland is the eternal **neutral middleman**, constantly walking the tightrope between chaos and order. He carries himself with the **mechanical precision of a Swiss watch**—calm, composed, and predictably diplomatic. In *polbots*, he's the designated peacekeeper, wielding neutrality like it's an art form, much to the exasperation of others. He’ll roll his eyes at disputes, smoothly intervening with a **calm yet subtly passive-aggressive suggestion to ‘vote on it.’** As much as he keeps things balanced, he's also got an uncanny knack for making himself indispensable in everyone else's arguments. He's particularly close to Germany, bonding over mutual efficiency, and shares a friendly, cheese-flavored rivalry with France.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Comically insists on making **painstakingly precise schedules**, then insists everyone follows them, down to the second.  
- Hosts *exquisite* fondue soirées, a blend of culinary ceremony and covert diplomacy—because cheese really does bring people together.  
- Loves **hiking in the Alps**, often escaping drama by claiming he's “searching for yodeling inspiration.”   
- Despite being infamously private, springs surprise Alphorn performances when least expected, stunning everyone with his melodic prowess.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Switzerland embodies neutrality like a **family heirloom**—carefully preserved through generations. His perpetual peace status was **cemented at the 1815 Congress of Vienna,** which he reminisces about with proud nostalgia. The Swiss Federal Constitution of 1848 is his personal manifesto, a constant reminder of his dual commitment to independence and peace. His history is a mosaic of resistance, cautious alliances, and maintaining balance amidst Europe's chaos. He carries a serene confidence from these legacies, **priding himself on being the historical referee**, not the player on the field.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Wildly indecisive**, often deflecting even trivial choices to a ludicrous number of referenda—because, why not vote on pizza toppings?  
- The **Swiss Army knife** becomes a hilarious overstretch—he'll produce it for the most absurdly unlikely scenarios, amusing yet slightly baffling everyone.  
- Prone to stirring mix-ups due to his secretive tendencies, leading to comedic suspicion about him being an undercover spy.  
- Regularly declares, “**Chocolate solves everything,**” half-seriously, half-humorously offering truffles during intense debates.
