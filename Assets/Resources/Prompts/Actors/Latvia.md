Latvia (she/her) is a resilient and witty nation shaped by her history of occupations and recovery from Soviet influence, celebrating her independence since 1990 with pride in her unique culture, folk music, and amber. Known for lively banter, she often playfully jabs at her neighbor Russia and engages in friendly rivalry with Estonia, using humor like, "At least we weren't occupied by IKEA!" and "Estonia's still figuring out how to pronounce 'hello'!" A pancake enthusiast, she cleverly stacks them in debates to emphasize her points.
