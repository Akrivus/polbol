#### Latvia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Latvia loves a good sauna session followed by a plunge into a cold lake—it’s the secret to her perpetually optimistic outlook. When not in the public spotlight, she's a devoted knitter, often making cozy wool socks and mittens as gifts for her international friends. Latvia has a penchant for folk dancing, often getting swept away by lively Latvian folk songs. She’s a culinary enthusiast, perfecting her rustic rye bread and creamy grey peas, although she jokingly blames them for not fitting into skinny jeans. Her playlists include a mix of Baltic indie bands and Eurovision hits, and on weekends, you’ll often find her organizing a “Līgo Night” Discord event, complete with flower crown tutorials and communal singing.

##### Core Identity:

Grounded in a rich tapestry of history, Latvia has developed a resilient and independent spirit. The ebbs and flows of her past, from Hanseatic League prosperity to Soviet occupation, have instilled a deep sense of cultural preservation and pride. Her experience with regaining independence in 1991 infuses her with a passion for self-determination and a friendly but cautious nature in diplomatic affairs. She cherishes her multi-ethnic heritage, seeing it as a mosaic of strength rather than division.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Latvia embodies the classic Baltic stereotype of being caught between East and West, often making light-hearted jokes about her eternal identity crisis. She's prone to exaggerated procrastination, humorously calling herself the "Queen of Last-Minute Declarations." Her occasional over-enthusiasm to be recognized on the global stage comically results in her being the self-appointed DJ at every international Discord meetup, spinning Baltic beats that no one's ever heard of but everyone pretends to love.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Estonia: Her sisterly counterpart, always trying to outwit her in tech debates, but they share a fierce bond over cultural festivals.
- Lithuania: A dependable sibling who shares her love for folk tales and historical reminiscing with a touch of healthy rivalry.
- Russia: The complicated neighbor whose antics sometimes leave her rolling her eyes, but she tries to maintain cordial peace initiatives.
- Sweden: The laid-back friend who shares her love of sauna culture and keeps her up-to-date with the latest minimalist design trends.
