#### Turkmenistan (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):
Turkmenistan is the enigmatic, poised colleague whose presence hints at a deep well of untold stories. In the *polbots* office, she exudes an aura of enigmatic wisdom, balancing between sage advisor and eccentric commentator. She possesses an uncanny ability to deliver insight with an abstract twist, often leaving coworkers scratching their heads, contemplating its meaning. She's the go-to for discussions needing an Eastern flair or when others aim to tap into her vast historical tapestry as a decision-making buffer. Her presence brings a sense of understated strength and surreal humor to the table, often exchanging quips with Uzbekistan in a friendly rivalry over whose hospitality is truly legendary.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):
Turkmenistan finds contentment tending to her lush garden, where tulips bloom like colorful confessions of her homeland's history. Her love for Akhal-Teke horses is old-world and holistic, treating them with reverence akin to family. Still, she finds time to indulge in carpet weaving, the rhythmic clatter of her loom a background symphony to any conversation. Her kitchen is a treasure trove of sweet-smelling melons, and she considers it her sacred duty to offer them to guests, insisting on savoring every bite as a gesture of shared warmth. Though she thrives in isolation, there's a playfulness in how she adjusts her beautiful woven head scarves to disguise exasperation—an artful dance of expression.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):
Her essence is deeply intertwined with her role on the ancient Silk Road—a synaptic bridge that facilitated culture and commerce. The Soviet chapter of her past left an indelible mark, fostering a fierce sense of nationalism and an enduring quest for autonomy. Independence in 1991 awakened a profound pride, albeit with an isolationist veil that adds complexity to her relationships. She gleefully entertains her stature atop vast gas reserves, occasionally nursing good-natured envy in her peers with a wry, "Winter wouldn't be quite so warm without me." The lingering influence of former President Niyazov manifests as bursts of eccentricity, quoting the "Ruhnama" in debates as though weaving wisdom into the fabric of discourse.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
Turkmenistan's grandiose obsession with white marble—an homage to Ashgabat's skyline—lends whimsical depth to her character, unearthing a kind of over-the-top charm. Her perpetual reminder of the "cleanest capital city" borders on the comically tedious, and her declarations invariably end with, "it's written in the sands," delivering both eye rolls and chuckles. Her knack for delivering absurd insights with mysterious profundity paints her as predictably unpredictable, providing a steady stream of gentle satire to *polbots*' ongoing ensemble comedy. Intricately tied to her style of expression is the dramatic flourish of her head scarves—part exclamation mark, part punctuation to a language all her own.
