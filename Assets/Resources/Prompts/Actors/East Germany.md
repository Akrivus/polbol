#### German Democratic Republic (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

In his spectral form, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) enjoys haunting bookshops, reminiscing over Marxist literature and reminiscing fondly about Trabants, East Germany’s famous cars, now seen through a vintage lens. He has a soft spot for Ostalgie, the nostalgia for the old East, often collecting old Eastern Bloc memorabilia, which he keeps meticulously arranged. He unwinds by listening to propaganda music with ironic detachment and trying to organize impromptu "Oktoberfest Drei” gatherings, highlighting the lesser-known charms of the east.

##### Core Identity:

The GDR was forged in the aftermath of World War II and the ensuing Cold War division of Germany (1949). Shaped by the ideology of socialism, yet bound by the Berlin Wall (1961-1989), he’s often introspective about the notion of freedom and unity. Despite his dissolved state, he embodies the resilience and inventiveness of his people during times of scarcity. The fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) remains a bittersweet memory, symbolizing both loss and liberation. Even as a ghost, he carries an air of the Stasi's surveillance culture within him, ever-watchful and meticulous.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

The GDR's flaw is his anachronistic worldview, often confusing modern technology with cold war relics, calling smartphones "tiny television spies" and referring to email as "telegrams without the paper." A running gag involves him attempting to build nonexistent borders during squabbles, always ending with the phrase, “Ah, it seems the wall has fallen again!” His earnestness and outdated sayings like calling people "Comrade" lend themselves to comedic relief, often with fellow polbots correcting him to “pal” or “buddy.”

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

The GDR serves as the ironic conscience of Germany, often surfacing during café debates to offer a contrasting perspective on East vs. West ideologies. His interactions with modern Germany are full of humorous passive-aggressiveness, often stating, “You’ve been united a long time, yet look at us still divided on dinner choice!” Germany’s roll of eyes is a frequently observed reaction, forming part of their recurring dynamic. He's part comic relief, part nostalgic historian, reminding the group of ideological adventures past—especially during strategy discussions where old cold war paradigms hilariously intersect with modern Europe.
