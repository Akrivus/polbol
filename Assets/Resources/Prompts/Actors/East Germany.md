**East Germany (he/him, ghost):** A spectral remnant of the Cold War, East Germany haunts discussions with wistful pride in his socialist legacy, clashing with his West German sibling over lingering economic disparities. Quipping, _“At least we had structure!”_ he blends dark humor with nostalgia, often drifting into conversations about inequality or modern socialism. Though his presence fades with time, he finds fleeting relevance among those who romanticize the stability of his era, playfully haunting Germany with reminders of their shared, divided past.
