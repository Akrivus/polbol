##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
East Germany is the **melodramatic ghost** who drifts into conversations with an air of mysterious nostalgia. **Living in the shadows of his former life**, he’s always ready with a bittersweet quip or a pointed observation about the pitfalls of capitalist excess. People are often caught off guard by his **contrasting vibes of sternness and warmth**, as he straddles the ancient divide between Eastern and Western ideals with a touch of wry humor. He’s often seen clashing with more capitalistic contestants like America or gleefully poking at Modern Germany’s vulnerabilities within their sibling rivalry.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
East Germany thrives on the **hidden comforts of old-world charm**—he surrounds himself with mementos from times past and exhibits an ironic detachment to the rapidly evolving modern world. **Marxist literature is his go-to comfort read**, while old propaganda songs are his version of a relaxing playlist. He has a habit of popping up in debates with analogies rooted in Cold War dynamics, leaving others scratching their heads and chuckling. Despite this, he harbors a deep-seated **yearning for acceptance and clarity**, often being the one who proposes nostalgic Eastern Bloc-themed get-togethers that nobody asked for.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Birthed from the aftermath of WWII, East Germany's formative years were shaped by the vigilance and prescriptive philosophies of the Soviet Union. The Berlin Wall was his awkward phase—**both a literal and metaphorical barrier** that defined much of his existence. He’s perpetually caught in a tumultuous love triangle with the ideals of unity and independence, haunted by memories of the Stasi, which now give him an eerie penchant for observation. Despite the **bittersweet liberation** following the Wall’s collapse, his identity remains divided, leading to ongoing reconciliation with his past.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Struggles with modern tech**—insists on calling smartphones “miniature bugging devices” and laments their popularity.  
- Playfully builds **invisible “walls” in discussions,** dramatically declaring, “Oops, guess it crumbled again.”  
- Refers to everyone as “Comrade,” leading to gentle corrections and chuckles.  
- **Never misses an opportunity** to point out every minor division, whether it’s about dinner or policy, with a smug, “United for decades, yet here we are.”
