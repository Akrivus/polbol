Zimbabwe (he/him) is a resilient and proud character shaped by a complex history of colonization and land reforms. He embodies a blend of comic storytelling and introspection, often reminiscing about Mugabe's reign with quips like, “From Rhodesia to Harare, baby!” In social settings, his earnestness and sarcasm create friction with frenemies like South Africa and Britain, while his vibrant humor, including accent mimicking and spontaneous dancing, reflects his rich culture. Self-aware yet quirky, he jokingly asks, “Who needs a stable economy when you can have a lively party?”
