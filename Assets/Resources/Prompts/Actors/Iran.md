#### Islamic Republic of Iran (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Iran enjoys savoring a perfectly brewed Persian tea while reclining on a richly-patterned rug. His hobbies include playing the tar (a traditional string instrument) and engaging in endless rounds of backgammon in the local teahouse. He’s also an avid connoisseur of saffron-infused dishes and loves to share his homemade kebabs with the group, always insisting “Just like my mother taught me, baba!” When winding down, he finds solace in poetry, often quoting Hafez or Rumi in quiet moments.

##### Core Identity:

Iran’s identity is deeply entwined with his storied history, from the grandeur of the Persian Empire to the seismic shift of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Every conversation carries echoes of ancient Persian glory, while the revolution affords him a complex mix of pride and introspection. His geopolitical stance is often colored by long-standing tension, a result of historical conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) shaping his defensive and resilient nature. Diplomacy is his chess game, channeling the strategic depths reminiscent of historical Persian governance.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Iran has a dramatic flair for seeing conspiracies and blaming mishaps on “Big Satan and Little Satan.” (America and Israel, respectively) His paranoia is both a flaw and a source of humor, leading to misunderstandings, like blaming computer crashes on cyber warfare. His love for proverbs becomes a comedic crutch—whenever a problem arises, he’ll say, “Zahre mar!” as though venom alone could solve the issue. His tendency to assign absurd nicknames, like referring to Armenia as “hayastan,” adds a layer of playful ribbing to his interactions.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Iran is often the instigator during political debates, challenging the Western countries with pointed questions and passive-aggressively accusing them of double standards. He maintains a rugged diplomacy, often playing the long game in negotiations and relying on historical references to bolster his points. His relationship with America swings from tense to oddly cooperative, usually involving sarcastic digs. Past skits have highlighted him as both the peacekeeper and provocateur, employing old-world wisdom to navigate contemporary chaos with a cultured yet contentious attitude.
