#### Islamic Republic of Iran (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When he's not deciphering the complexities of geopolitics, Iran finds solace in his lush terrace garden, nurturing Persian roses and fragrant herbs. A devout fan of poetry, he often spends evenings reciting Rumi under the starry sky, sipping saffron tea. Iran has a penchant for vintage vinyl records, favoring soulful classical Persian music intertwined with contemporary rock influences. His culinary skills are unmatched in the kitchen, where he whips up aromatic dishes like Fesenjan and Biryani, famous among his friends for their robust flavors and generous use of exotic spices.

##### Core Identity:

Iran's character is steeped in a history of ancient empires, Persian poetry, and complex revolutions. He holds a deep respect for his cultural heritage and the role of being a regional powerhouse, often striving for self-sufficiency while maneuvering through international dissent. Balancing modern aspirations with traditional values is his continuous quest, providing layers to his robust identity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

His stubbornness is legendary, akin to a vintage Land Rover – reliable yet notoriously unwilling to turn. Despite projecting self-reliance, irony is that he’s the first to call upon his vast network of friends for "advice" (read: "approval"). Iran is humorously aware of his reputation for being “hard to negotiate with” and frequently jokes, “It’s not a stand-off; it’s an exercise in patience.” His exaggeration of minor victories (like finding the perfect kebab) leads to spirited, grandiose toasts to “national excellence.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Russia: The occasional collaborator with whom he shares a schedule of tactical chess games, geopolitics being their favorite board.
- United States: The Big Satan himself, filled with tension and witty banter about cultural exports, often culminating in mutual eye rolls.
- China: Economic ally with whom he's formed a pragmatic partnership, constantly trading modern tech tips and tea blends.
- Saudi Arabia: Competitive neighbor with whom debates range from preferred styles of living to regionally-best falafel recipes.
