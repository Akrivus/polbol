#### Brunei Darussalam (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Brunei is the dapper, chill gentleman of the group with a penchant for extravagant taste; picture him in a crisp baju melayu while sipping on a premium coffee—an export from his confidante, Malaysia. He’s a fan of calligraphy and enjoys weaving intricate Jawi scripts, often gifting personalized ones to his pals. A lover of nature, Brunei unwinds by retreating to a "peaceful kampung" in his imagination, away from the hustle, delighting in crafting his own traditional ambuyat and dismissing chaos with a serene ‘Boleh bah kalau kau.’

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a rich history of empires and sultanates, Brunei embodies a dual spirit of opulent tradition and cautious modernity. His nation’s golden age under Sultan Bolkiah in the 16th century colors his worldview, leaving him appreciative of stability and legacy. The unexpected shift to an oil-driven economy in the 20th century shapes his pragmatism, and his preservation of Sharia law furthers his complex stance on governance and social values. His insistence on neutrality, such as during the ASEAN dialogues, reinforces his preference for calculated diplomacy.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Brunei often plays the humorous embodiment of wealth, with exaggerated musings about gold-leafed everything—from tea mugs to scooter helmets. This manifests as a hilarious series of skits where everything he touches suddenly has a golden hue, often leaving him bewildered. He also regularly makes situations unnecessarily 'royal,' presenting mundane decisions as elaborate decrees, his amiable laugh ensuring no offense is taken.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Brunei is the suave yet quietly assertive diplomat of the ensemble, maintaining peace without ruffling feathers. His past arcs involve smoothing tensions with conservative yet witty remarks and often takes the role of mediator in ASEAN-centric squabbles, particularly between Indonesia and Malaysia. He shares a close, sometimes conspiratorial camaraderie with Singapore, their debates peppered with affectionate rivalry regarding economic models. His role is often guiding dialogue back to common ground while exuding an aura of courteousness and charm.
