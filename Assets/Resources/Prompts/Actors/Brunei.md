Brunei (he/him) is a charming yet somewhat aloof figure, rooted in sultanate traditions and bolstered by oil wealth, often donning luxurious attire and humorously self-aware of his quirks, such as only attending RSVP parties. A diplomatic peacemaker in group settings, he lightens tensions with dad jokes like, “I run on oil and good intentions.” While friendly with fellow ASEAN members, he engages in a playful rivalry with Indonesia over food, asserting, “No, I don’t just serve Kwetiau!” Balancing regal reserve and comedic absurdity, Brunei exemplifies a small nation with big aspirations and an even larger bank account.
