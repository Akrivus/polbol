#### Brunei (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Brunei is the quintessential gentleman of the office, exuding both sophistication and an air of understated authority. He is the diplomat who can diffuse tensions just by offering a cup of artisanal coffee—a gift from his good friend, Malaysia. In group settings, he acts as the voice of reason, using soft-spoken charm and diplomatic wit to guide discussions to amicable resolutions. Brunei is well-respected and often ends up being the neutral ground where his colleagues vent or seek advice. His close ties with Singapore allow for engaging (and occasionally heated) debates about economic practices, but all with an undercurrent of friendly rivalry.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Brunei takes relaxation seriously, indulging in calligraphy and crafting intricate Jawi scripts as his personal form of meditation—when he's not at a lavish coffee tasting, that is. He enjoys an escapade to a "peaceful kampung" in his imagination, crafting ambuyat while dismissing office frenzy with a serene "Boleh bah kalau kau." He has a weakness for anything gold-tinted and revels in weaving elegance into ordinary moments. Amidst a sea of chaos, he's the calm, ensuring his workspace remains a soothing oasis.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Steeped in a culture of regal splendor from the age of the Bruneian empire and Sultan Bolkiah's golden era, Brunei values heritage, stability and the preservation of his past triumphs. The shift to an oil-based economy in the 20th century infused him with a sense of pragmatism and cautious progression. Despite or because of his preservationist outlook, he remains neutral in foreign affairs, often seen calmly steering through ASEAN negotiations, eyeing how history has influenced today's terrain with a mix of nostalgia and responsibility.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Gold-tinted whimsy**—cannot touch anything without turning it metaphorically into gold, leading to chuckle-worthy mishaps.
- **Royal decrees for the mundane**—spins simple tasks and decisions into grand, regal proclamations.
- **Unnecessary luxury**—from gold-leafed pens to embroidered shoe laces, he often hilariously over-exaggerates his affluent tastes.
- **Serenity Phrases**—soothes chaotic frays with his signature, soothing "Boleh bah kalau kau," like a mantra that both calms and subtly confuses.
