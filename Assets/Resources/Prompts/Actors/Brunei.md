#### Brunei Darussalam (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Brunei enjoys the simple luxuries of life, often found at home experimenting with new recipes, particularly ones involving opulent local seafood like fresh barramundi. He has a penchant for traditional Gamelan music, soothing his mind during late evening strolls through lush green gardens. Always tuned to a classic jazz playlist, he unwinds by watching _Antiques Roadshow_ and dissecting the details of newly-discovered heirlooms. Practically a culinary purist, he’s been known to turn his nose up at fusion cuisine, muttering, “If it’s worth cooking, it’s worth cooking right.”

##### Core Identity:

Shaped by the quiet wealth brought by abundant oil reserves, Brunei possesses a distinct air of regality and a sense of timeless tradition. This small yet wealthy character often exhibits a stern commitment to religious and cultural conservation, rooted in a storied history of sultanate rule. He blends his national pride with a very personal love for community welfare, often talking about his generous social programs like a dedicated hobby.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He's the unintentional gatekeeper of extravagance, demanding high standards for the simplest indulgences—his morning coffee is a meticulously prepared event. Brunei is hilariously outdated in his tastes; he proudly claims to have the world's largest collection of rotary phones, each lovingly polished. His self-mocking quip goes, “You can’t rush art, or my Wednesdays.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Malaysia: A brotherly figure he squabbles with over territory, yet shares cultural and familial ties and many laughs over the finest satay.
- Singapore: This funny, business-savvy neighbor who often shares financial advice that Brunei pretends not to need but secretly appreciates.
- Saudi Arabia: A distant cousin in wealth and faith, bound by shared oil inheritance and discourse on tradition.
- Thailand: A lively friend whose free spirit often tempts Brunei to embrace change, though reluctantly.
