#### Lithuania (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Lithuania has a penchant for long walks in the lush Trakai forests, often with a cozy scarf, even in summer. She's a whiz at making cepelinai (stuffed potato dumplings) and insists they taste best while listening to indie folk music—especially songs by Lithuanian artists like Ieva Zasimauskaitė. On chilled-out evenings, she uncorks a bottle of her favorite apple cider and catches up on Baltic crime dramas. Lithuania also has a guilty pleasure for antique collecting, often scouring online marketplaces for Soviet-era relics.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a rich tapestry of history that includes grand duchies and tenacious resistance against various empires, Lithuania carries a pragmatic optimism. She’s fiercely proud of her unique language and tennis stars, keeping her spirit competitive yet friendly. Independence and resilience are woven into her very soul, much like the traditional weaving crafts her grandmothers taught her. Despite her historical scars, she remains a voice for peace and unity in a world that sometimes feels chaotic.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Lithuania has a hilariously stubborn streak about her “cold climate survival skills,” constantly soliciting advice on “How to Survive a Few Degrees Below Zero” even as she dons an excessive number of layers. Her dry wit often comes with a cheeky grin when she’s faced with modern technology struggles, muttering, “Why can’t we fax it?” Peeking into her shopping cart, you might find an absurd amount of rye bread—because you can never have enough.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Latvia: Her closest confidante; they share a sisterly bond that includes inside jokes and a friendly rivalry over who brews the better beer.
- Poland: A former partner-in-mischief; they've moved past historical bickers to celebrate their shared heritage, though Poland still teases her about “that one time at Grunwald.”
- Russia: An uneasy but necessary neighbor; despite historical tensions, Lithuania approaches interactions with humor and a touch of cautious pragmatism.
- Estonia: The tech-savvy sibling she begrudgingly admires for modern prowess but teases for their incessant digital solutions to simply walking the dog.
