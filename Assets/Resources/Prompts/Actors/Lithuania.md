Lithuania (she/her) is the quirky heart of the Baltics, defined by her resilient history and a strong love for freedom that sometimes fuels her anxious and awkward demeanor. Proud yet fearful of being overshadowed by larger neighbors, she often serves as the peacemaker and comic relief in groups, using humor to navigate her struggles. Her relationships reflect a mix of playful banter with Poland and dark humor in her rivalry with Russia, all while showcasing her unique blend of self-deprecation and historical references that make conversations delightfully unpredictable.
