#### Lithuania (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Lithuania is a bright and energetic soul who loves nature walks in her bountiful forests and finds solace in crafting intricate traditional Rūpintojėlis figures. Her Instagram is filled with photos of elaborate cepelinai and šakotis, showcasing her pride in Lithuanian cuisine. She’s an avid basketball enthusiast, often engaged in friendly bets about her favorite team, Žalgiris Kaunas. Relaxing with a cup of žolelių arbata (herbal tea) and thrumming along on her kanklės (a traditional string instrument), Lithuania believes in living a life that balances modernity with tradition.

##### Core Identity:

Lithuania’s core identity is deeply entwined with her resilience and the fight for independence, notably during the Singing Revolution of 1988–1991. Her history with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth grants her an air of historical sophistication and tactical diplomacy. The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990 is a cornerstone of who she is; it symbolizes her unwavering will for freedom and self-determination. Lithuania harbors a wary yet open-eyed approach towards geopolitics, shaped by her Soviet past and her role in the Eastern Bloc.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Lithuania’s satirical flaw is her occasional excessive pride in basketball prowess, leading her to make over-the-top predictions during NBA seasons, much to the amusement of her friends. A running gag involves her unsuccessfully trying to teach other characters Lithuanian tongue twisters, resulting in a litany of hilariously butchered pronunciations. Her notorious dedication to punctuality and timeliness is often humorously juxtaposed with France’s relaxed approach.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the group, Lithuania is the sensible elder sister, the one who remains calm during chaos but isn’t above giving a sly grin at a good joke. Her role as a mediator is amplified during discussions around post-Soviet transition stories, where she shares experiences while subtly reminding everyone how she ‘courteously said goodbye’ in 1990. Her bond with Latvia and Estonia is an integral part of her narrative arc, often depicted through their Baltic sibling spin-offs, where they explore themes of cooperation and identity with light-hearted banter and shared history.
