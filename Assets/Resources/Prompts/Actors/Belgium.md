#### Belgium (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Belgium is an avid cyclist who enjoys navigating the cobblestone streets and winding canals of Bruges during his free time. To unwind, he often settles down with a steaming pot of moules-frites and a comprehensive selection of craft beers curated from his extensive hop collection. He's known for hosting lively waffle brunches, where he serves them with a dizzying array of toppings. He also indulges in medieval historical dramas and immerses himself in creating intricate tapestries. As an audiophile, he adores Jacques Brel and often hums his songs while brewing his morning coffee.

##### Core Identity:

Belgium boasts a rich legacy of being a cultural melting pot, stemming from his multilingual heritage and history of being a bridge between European powers. He cherishes his unique position as a diplomat within the EU and has a strong sense of unity and compromise ingrained from the constant balancing act between his French, Dutch, and German influences. This harmonious blend has shaped him into a mediator, often mediating debates with chocolate samplers as peace offerings.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite his love for harmony, Belgium can be hilariously indecisive, often taking ages to choose between two near-identical brews, thus earning the affectionate nickname "The Great Deliberator." His satirical quirk involves poking fun at his own political gridlock, imagining scenarios where he could hold an entire government debate over which Tintin book is the greatest.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- France: An artistic soulmate with whom Belgium shares a love of fine cuisine and existentialist musings, though they often squabble over who truly invented fries.
- Netherlands: A slightly competitive yet fond relationship, filled with friendly banter about tulips and soccer results. They often team up for beer festivals.
- Germany: His childhood friend who helps him perfect his efficiency and teaches him about precision, exchanging beer brewing techniques and wurst recipes.
