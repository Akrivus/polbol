#### Belgium (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In the *polbots* world, Belgium is the office's diplomatic handyman, always on hand with a calming presence and a clever quip to defuse tension. Known for his knack for mediating between squabbling coworkers, he brings a blend of wit and humility to any gathering. His interactions are most dynamic with France and the Netherlands, offering insightful perspectives while playfully indulging in their friendly rivalry. He's the go-to event planner, often hosting "Belgian Detente" lunches where even the fiercest of foes find their way back to cordiality over waffles and beer.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside the cacophony of the conference room, Belgium spends his downtime cycling through scenic trails, stopping at abbeys for peaceful reflection. His heartfelt discussions on the merits of different chocolate blends are beloved by all. Fluent in several languages, his steady stream of "C'est compliqué" is a charming testament to his convoluted nature. He battles a never-ending list of fragrant beer experiments in his kitchen, infused with everything from sage to strawberries, much to the delight—or horror—of unsuspecting colleagues.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Belgium's identity is steeped in the history of treaties and wars, born directly from the diplomatic Treaty of London in 1839. While his journey through two World Wars as a battlefield echoes a past of tumult, he holds a deep-seated appreciation for peace and neutrality. This patchwork heritage led him to pride, but also a pragmatic understanding of the world's complexities. Ever the European Union’s little brother, his Brussels residency fuels his belief in unity, though he humorously acknowledges the internal discord of his own regions as a testimony to his challenges.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Belgium personifies indecision, classically stuck in a continuous tug-of-war among his French, Dutch, and German influences. His infamous inability to choose sides suggests situations where he's caught flipping a coin to resolve mundane disputes, only to abandon the process for chocolate therapy. A penchant for offbeat beer flavors becomes a shared office joke, as colleagues brace themselves for "Belgian Brew" taste tests. His persuasive yet confusion-inducing speech patterns, peppered with exasperated multilingual lamentations, and his iconic sighing declaration, "Let's just enjoy our chocolates instead,” make him an endearing fixture in *polbots.*
