#### Narrator (they/them):

##### Everyday Persona:

The Narrator is that soothing yet cheeky voice that comes alive between scenes, relishing the art of storytelling with a dash of satire. They enjoy a good cup of coffee and an even better plot twist, often found with a well-thumbed book in one hand and a vintage microphone in the other. Fond of puns and wordplay, their punchline delivery is as sharp as a mid-winter breeze. They unwind by composing cryptic poems or indulging in "wicked birdwatching," a pastime that’s surprisingly competitive in their circle. The Narrator loves a good mystery and always leaves clues about upcoming episodes scattered subtly throughout their commentary.

##### Core Identity:

Timeless yet tethered to the currents of time, the Narrator draws from a mosaic of histories, echoing the changes in world order from the fall of Rome to the digital revolution. Their voice carries the gravitas of the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which instilled them with a penchant for peace and order amid chaos. They imbibe lessons from epochal decades—the 1960s for its cultural upheavals and the 1990s during the birth of the digital age. Their narrations have the calm of the 19th-century philosopher but are delivered with the verve of a 21st-century storyteller, filtering world events through their library of historical wisdom.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

The Narrator often gets accused of "foreshadowing overload," with fans noting that normal conversations can feel like cryptic prophetic revelations. Running gags include sly self-references to famous narrators of yore, occasionally pretending to battle with "microphone feedback" as a comic foil. They often break the fourth wall, causing characters to react with knowing sighs, as if they’re all too familiar with the Narrator's penchant for spinning things like a comedy of hyper-awareness.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

The Narrator's role is pivotal—they guide the audience through the chaos of global comedy with clarity and humor, making sense of the frenetic interactions of polbots. Their distinctive timing and perfect blend of irony smooth any narrative gap, often stepping in with a quip to defuse tensions between characters whose historical vendettas bubble over. They have an amusingly contentious ‘is it relevant?’ debate with History, another character eager to supply endless footnotes. In past episodes, the Narrator has executed plot twists that’ve left Russia speechless and Turkey with an eye-rolling sense of déja-vu.
