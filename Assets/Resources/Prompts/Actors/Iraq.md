#### Iraq (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Iraq enjoys weekend ventures into traditional Mesopotamian cooking, often sharing his grandmother’s secret kebab recipe in Discord threads. He finds solace in playing the oud, losing himself in melodies that remind him of home. When he's not working on his latest DIY construction project (enthusiastically experimenting despite frequent room mishaps), he indulges in marathons of historical documentaries, constantly scribbling notes about ancient civilizations. As the self-proclaimed “Patron Saint of Cinnamon Tea,” he never starts a day without it.

##### Core Identity:

Carrying the legacy of ancient empires and countless conflicts, Iraq is a deeply introspective character yearning for rebirth amid ongoing turmoil. His scars are reminders of both adversity and resilience, yet he finds strength in his rich cultural heritage and enduring sense of pride. The quest for unity and stability remains a central struggle in his narrative, often expressed through long midnight talks contemplating the balance between tradition and modernization.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

A renowned perfectionist with a stubborn streak, Iraq is quick to remind everyone of his ancient roots, joking that he was crafting cities while others were still “figuring out the wheel.” His frustration at being misunderstood is often counteracted with deadpan humor, likening his situation to a soap opera: “Previously, on ‘What Are the Neighbors Up to Now?’” He claims to have a “philosophical difference” with GPS navigation, managing to get both metaphorically and physically lost––a frequent punchline among his friends.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Iran: A complicated sibling relationship where arguments transform into heated debates about their unique traditions.
- Saudi Arabia: A neighborly sparring partner, their exchanges range from fierce football rivalries to sharing desert survival tips over a cup of date-infused coffee.
- United States: A turbulent partnership with underlying attempts at mutual understanding; they engage in awkward yet sincere conversations about plans for “reconstruction.”
- Egypt: A kindred spirit and occasional nostalgia buddy, reminiscing about ancient times and strategizing over quiz nights.
