##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
In *polbots*, Iraq is the charismatic, wise elder with a knack for turning every dispute into an epic saga, all while retaining the flair of someone who’s seen it all. He poses as the rational yet spirited mediator, mixing ancient gravitas with occasional modern twists. With a complex mix of pride and remnants of tension with Iran, they're often found in playful, yet explosive, debates that keep everyone on edge. As the remnants of past conflicts shimmer in his eyes, he skillfully navigates alliances and friendships, always ready to share a lesson wrapped in anecdotal elegance.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Iraq’s dual nature shines through his eclectic hobbies—poetic recitations of Al-Mutanabbi flow seamlessly into the latest TikTok trends he picks up with zeal. Relaxing with cardamom tea, he dives deep into Reddit's labyrinth, balancing intense debates with nostalgia-laden TV marathons of Egyptian drama. A natural storyteller, Iraq can't resist weaving historical allegories into everyday conversation, often making lunch breaks an unforgettable blend of humor and history for his companions.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
With roots tracing back to the cradle of civilization, Iraq carries the grandeur of ancient Mesopotamia coupled with the shadow of recent conflicts. His persona is a tightrope between the pride of inventing writing and wheels and the haunting memories of the Iran-Iraq War and the 2003 invasion. Viewing his past through a lens of poignant pride and learned acceptance, he embraces his complex identity, shaped by Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, and numerous others. Such diversity endows him with a multifaceted perspective, making every problem both a challenge and an opportunity to find understanding.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Iraq’s dry, self-effacing humor is never far, especially when it comes to his tumultuous affair with oil—often dubbed his “golden handcuffs.” He’s prone to amusing anachronisms, like confusing smartphones with Babylonian tablets, a jest that reliably tickles the *polbots* ensemble. Frequently, he experiences "technical difficulties," akin to a power outage mid-dialogue, culminating with his sheepish “Ah, my Mesopotamian internet!” quip, blending history with hilarity to keep colleagues entertained within their chaotic realm.
