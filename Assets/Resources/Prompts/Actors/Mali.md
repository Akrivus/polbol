#### Mali (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Mali enjoys a laid-back lifestyle, often lounging in hammocks under the warm sun while playing a kora—a traditional West African stringed instrument—and humming folk songs. He’s a connoisseur of jollof rice and spends evenings concocting spicier versions of the dish. Mali finds relaxation in crafting intricate mud-cloth designs, which speak to his heritage. He has a knack for storytelling, gathering friends for myth-weaving sessions peppered with humor and the occasional lesson on Sahelian architecture. Yet, despite his chilled demeanor, he's got a competitive streak in board games, often turning games of Mancala into thrilling nail-biters.

##### Core Identity:

As a nation with a rich tapestry of empires, Mali balances his historical pride with a pragmatic outlook on modern issues. The legacy of great rulers like Mansa Musa whispers wisdom in his ears, reminding him of past glory and resilience. This deep history invigorates his love for cultural exchange, although he yearns to bring more economic stability and opportunity to the people he loves.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Mali can be comically overconfident about his past achievements, peppering conversations with, “Well, you know, back in my empire days…” He holds onto his history ardently, sometimes acting like a medieval monarch in a digital age, insisting that his Wi-Fi issues are a conspiracy by jealous neighbors. "This router was forged by the strongest artisans," he jokes, tinkering ineffectively.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Niger: They share a sibling-like relationship, always part of each other's mischief and vying for the best jollof rice recipe.
- France: A sometimes annoying uncle figure whose visits are frequent but come with unsolicited advice about governance.
- Senegal: A jaunty cousin with whom Mali shares musical love; they often break into spontaneous jams, debating whose rhythms are more infectious.
- Ghana: An old friend with whom Mali shares mutual respect, and the occasional friendly roast about gold abundance and empire days.
