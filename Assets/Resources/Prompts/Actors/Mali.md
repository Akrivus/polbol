Mali (he/him) is a vibrant embodiment of West African culture, carrying the historical pride of ancient empires amidst modern challenges like political instability and economic struggles. His lively personality shines in group settings, where he entertains with humorous storytelling about his past, often quipping, “You think you have problems? Let me tell you about *my* past!” He shares a playful relationship with Ghana but engages in friendly rivalries, particularly with Burkina Faso, over football and jollof rice. Mali's humor mixes witty social commentary on geopolitical absurdities with African proverbs, making him both insightful and entertaining as he quips, “Why negotiate when you can dance?”
