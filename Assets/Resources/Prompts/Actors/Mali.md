From the scholarly cities of Timbuktu and Gao, he inherits a hunger for knowledge and harmony. His anti-colonial past breeds an independent spirit, and his journey through modern democracy steels his resolve for resilience and dialogue. These experiences color his worldview with shades of nostalgia and a fervent belief in the power of unity through diversity.

A light-hearted mystery surrounds his secret claim of knowing "the real location of Timbuktu," a comical testament to the weight of myth over reality. His spontaneous switches into drum solos in dangerously dull meetings provide a unique, catchy diversion that never fails to draw laughter and reluctant applause.
