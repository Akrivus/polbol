#### Ireland (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Ireland is the charming rogue of the group, with a twinkle in his eye and a pint of Guinness never far from reach. His hobbies include playing the fiddle and ceaselessly perfecting his famous soda bread recipe, which he swears is better than his mum's. When he's not embroiled in debates, he enjoys "a good craic" at the pub or wandering the Irish countryside, often wearing a worn flat cap and wool sweater that he insists are "vintage, not old." He's a fan of folk music, with The Pogues and Hozier on constant rotation, and is known for his colorful idioms and hearty laughter.

##### Core Identity:

Ireland's identity is deeply rooted in his history of struggle and resilience. The Easter Rising of 1916 ignited his spirit of independence, steering him on a path of self-determination. The Troubles in Northern Ireland shaped his contemporary outlook, making him empathetic to any struggles for freedom and peace. Ireland ardently supports the underdog and is fervently anti-imperialistic, loudly opposing anything he perceives as British meddling. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement remains a touchstone, representing peace and the power of dialogue, so he often values compromise, though not without a side of skepticism.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Ireland's knack for hyperbole is both his comedic gift and a running gag—"If I had a euro for every time someone underestimated me, I’d buy the English Channel and declare it a public swimming pool." He has an exaggerated aversion to anything slightly British, often resulting in over-the-top mockery followed by playful apologies, especially to America. His interactions are peppered with whimsical, often mysterious references to faeries and leprechauns, a play on classic stereotypes that he embraces with a wink and a nod.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Ireland often plays the role of the passionate instigator, injecting life and humor into discussions with his fiery spirit. He is quick to challenge the status quo, advocating for the downtrodden and favoring grassroots solutions. His historic and cultural tiffs with Britain fuel some of the funniest (and most heated) skits on the show, where they bicker over everything from tea to territory. Despite this, he's also seen as the sympathetic ear among the group, often drawing reluctant admiration for his commitment to social justice and egalitarian principles. His past skits often feature him leading humorous "digital revolutions," aiming for a better, fairer world—even if it means navigating through endless old folk tales and witty banter.
