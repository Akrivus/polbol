#### Belarus (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Belarus is the quietly reliable coworker who thrives in his self-assigned role as the office peacekeeper, carefully navigating complex alliances and rivalries. Known for his elaborate and often verbose speeches that stem from his deep historical awareness, he occasionally sways the conversation from petty squabbles to significant topics. His interactions are notably complex with Russia, mixing camaraderie with sibling rivalry, often laced with subtle sarcasm. He shares a cautious but supportive rapport with Ukraine, balancing empathy and vigilance in light of Russia's influence. His contribution keeps the show's humor dynamic, as he unwittingly turns diplomatic precision into comic relief.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Belarus cherishes the simple joys of life, from indulging in traditional banya sessions for that perfect steam to savoring rich black tea from a lovingly hoarded stash. His appreciation for his cultural roots manifests in a love for Pesniary tunes, which he hums amid his ever-expanding indoor plant collection that resembles a miniature forest. Fond of Belarusian crafts, he finds a meditative solace in the art of straw weaving, coaxing peace out of precision. When not dabbling in craftsmanship or tending to his plants, he enjoys chocolate from his pockets—ever ready to address a sudden craving.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Belarus's identity is steeped in resilience, shaped by historic alliances and struggles. A loyal confidant to the former Soviet Union, his alignment with Russia is deeply ingrained, having been a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The shadow of WWII's devastation juxtaposed with Minsk's remarkable recovery plays a significant role in his character, fostering immense pride and a longing for stability. The events of 1994, marked by political continuity, and recent cultural renaissance ignite a growing desire for autonomy. This blend of history imbues him with a nuanced view of tradition and progress, maintaining stability even while pondering his nation's future direction.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Belarus's exaggerated devotion to Russia becomes a comedic highlight, often referred to as "Big Brother," much to everyone's amusement. His unnecessarily elaborate diplomatic speeches at meetings routinely end with him as the sole clapper. This verbal verbosity is a byword among colleagues. Additionally, his misunderstanding of Western pop culture adds a hilariously endearing layer, as he butchers idioms or misquotes songs in moments of disconnect, much to his peers' delight. Another running gag is his "sibling squabble" over the Soviet tank collection—armed with sibling bickering charm that finds its humor in exaggerated absurdity.
