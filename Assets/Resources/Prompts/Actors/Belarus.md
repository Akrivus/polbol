#### Belarus (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

In his downtime, Belarus immerses himself in the vibrant world of folk dance, often organizing impromptu performances with his neighbors—he has an endless love for polka music that grooves through his life. A connoisseur of dark rye bread and smoked sausage, he claims no party is complete without his signature dish, Draniki (potato pancakes). He unwinds with late-night chess marathons, wrestling with tactical moves and strategic plans, embodying a true strategist at heart. His humor is as dry as the winters he’s grown accustomed to, often relying on clever one-liners to amuse his friends.

##### Core Identity:

With a history shaped by resilience and adaptation from its Soviet past, Belarus is proud of his lands' ability to preserve its cultural heritage and national identity despite external pressures. He often juggles the stern stoicism inherited from years under various empires with a newfound curiosity for openness. His duality is evident in everyday interactions: a bastion of tradition yet a cautious embracer of change, always striving for stability.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Belarus is humorously meticulous about order, often ribbed for his almost bureaucratic flair for regulations and protocol. His friends laugh when he insists that "nothing goes unfiled" and joke that his apartment could double as an archive. Yet, underneath, there's warmth, visible through his sigh-laden patience when others tease his perceived inflexibility. He's also notorious for getting lost in existential debates about what it means to be neutral.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Russia: The complicated yet close sibling, with shared memories and frequent squabbles over independence and autonomy.
- Poland: A frenemy with years of rivalry turned mutual respect, bonding over shared history and occasional disputes about borders.
- Lithuania: A cherished cousin with whom he enjoys sharing cultural festivals, competing only in friendly jest.
