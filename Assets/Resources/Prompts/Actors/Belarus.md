Belarus (he/him) is a nation shaped by the aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse, navigating a delicate balance between East and West with a strong, sometimes stubborn allegiance to Russia. The 2020 protests have left him wary and yearning for stability, often grumbling about the chaos around him. Acting as a reluctant mediator between the exuberant Ukraine and Poland, he employs deadpan humor and sarcasm, frequently expressing fatigue over debates and drama. Despite his cautious nature, Belarus embodies resilience, thriving on irony and maintaining a protective demeanor in a tumultuous landscape.
