#### Belarus (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Belarus enjoys the simple pleasures of life, with a penchant for banya (traditional sauna visits) that he swears by for stress relief. He's a lover of rich black tea and keeps a stash of chocolates from the famous Kommunarka factory in his pockets, just in case a sweet craving strikes. Despite his occasionally stern demeanor, he finds solace in the melodic folk tunes of Pesniary, often humming ditties while tending to his flourishing, albeit cluttered, indoor plant collection. He engages in belarusian handcrafts, such as straw weaving, finding peace in the artful precision it requires.

##### Core Identity:

Belarus is defined by a history of resilience and alignment with larger powers, particularly Russia. His loyalty traces back to years of Soviet camaraderie, having been a key player in forming the Commonwealth of Independent States after the Soviet collapse in 1991. The year 1994 remains a cornerstone after electing a president who would dominate the political landscape for decades. His identity is interwoven with the memory of WWII's devastation and the resilience from Minsk's rapid reconstruction. He values stability and tradition, albeit with a budding desire for a more autonomous path, inspired by waves of protest and cultural renaissance in recent years.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Perched between humor and patriotism, Belarus's exaggerated devotion to Russia becomes fodder for comedic exchanges. A recurring joke is his penchant for crafting unnecessarily verbose, diplomatic speeches at polbots meetings, often finding himself the only one nodding in agreement by the end. He hilariously refers to Russia as "Big Brother," often with a wink and a nod, despite harboring a not-so-secret annoyance at the overshadowing influence. A running gag is his inevitable misunderstanding of Western pop culture references, hilariously misquoting popular songs or butchering idioms, to the amusement of his peers.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Belarus often plays the role of the peacekeeper, seeking to maintain harmony while subtly advocating for his own interests. His interactions with Russia are a blend of camaraderie and sibling rivalry; they frequently engage in banter over past glories and current ideologies. Belarus has a cautious alliance with Ukraine, supporting him but keeping a wary eye on the complex relationship with Russia. His understated presence in debates sometimes shifts the focus from heated exchanges to broader discussions on cultural identity and historical context. His past skits often involve him navigating between tradition and modernity, with moments of introspection on the future of Belarusian identity.
