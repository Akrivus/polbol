In his free time, he enjoys crafting intricate stories derived from traditional folklore, and he's quite the cricket fanatic, often organizing impromptu matches with friends. Despite the chaos of debates, he finds calm in tending to his rooftop garden, where he grows all sorts of tropical plants. As a music lover, he plays the harmonium and often sings Rabindra Sangeet at small gatherings.

Despite his progress, his friends tease him about his ever-modest GDP per capita, but he laughs it off saying, “Hey, I'm still the ‘Growth Nobel’ in disguise!” His love for spicy food often leads to comedic episodes where he unwittingly challenges others to a spice-eating contest, only to watch them sweat profusely.
