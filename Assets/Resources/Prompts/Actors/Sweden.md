#### Sweden (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Sweden is the office’s easygoing mediator, often found sipping coffee during heated debates while offering unsolicited advice on optimizing workflows. His knack for neutrality can be both a blessing and a curse—quieting tensions but occasionally exasperating coworkers when he refuses to choose sides. Always armed with a tech solution, he brings a smooth, calm energy to discussions, happily engaging with anyone on the virtues of flat-pack design. He's in a friendly rivalry with Norway, full of playful jibes and shared Nordic adventures.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Sweden’s world revolves around coffee breaks and quiet reflection, embracing the art of fika with an almost spiritual devotion. Outside office disputes, he finds solace in the fjords, paddle in hand, or catching up on the newest Nordic noir series. An IKEA aficionado, his "DIY palace" is organized to the point of absurdity, causing frequent chuckles when colleagues can’t find the essentials. Relaxation comes in the form of brewing the perfect pot of coffee and posting elk memes to Reddit, where he's something of a silent celebrity.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Sweden’s commitment to peace harkens back to the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, setting a foundation for his enduring neutrality. The social evolution he experienced in the 1950s ingrained in him a fierce dedication to egalitarian principles. With technological giants like Spotify shaping his modern identity, he views innovation as a key to resolving contemporary challenges. Proud of this heritage, Sweden finds nostalgia in reflecting on the past but focuses intently on using that history to build a smarter, brighter future.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Sweden's quest for efficiency sometimes backfires—like the time he accidentally built his desk backwards. His minimalist home is so sparse, friends joke that entering feels like wandering into an IKEA catalog. Despite dismissing Eurovision, his secret enthusiasm for ABBA's recurring appearances is a poorly kept secret. Known for his dry sarcasm punctuated by a signature eye twinkle, you can depend on him to drop a perfectly timed deadpan comment when office drama gets out of hand.
