##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Sweden walks into episodes with the **effortless cool of someone who never gets ruffled** by global drama. He’s the **zen master of neutrality**, always sitting on the fence with an artful coffee in hand. Sweden loves giving people the impression he is the **wise elder** of the Nordics, dropping insights about minimalism as if they were universal truths. Most see him as the guy who’s got it together—until his **deep-seated rivalry** with Denmark or Norway leads to **hilariously passive-aggressive moments.** He avoids direct clashes, opting instead for the **deathly glare of Nordic disapproval** when things get heated.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Ritualizes coffee breaks** with an almost cult-like reverence—if you don’t do fika right, you’ve already lost his respect.  
- Enthusiastically **organizes his life** as if trying to out-IKEA IKEA itself, often leaving out the essentials.  
- Underneath the guise of stoic calm, he has a secret **obsession with detective dramas**, fancying himself a real-life investigator when office mysteries arise.

Sweden views his past as a mosaic of dissolving empires and anonymous diplomacy—his greatest decision was choosing to be a **peaceful, neutral force** after the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, which he talks about as an enlightened moment, like quitting a bad habit. The **progressive welfare state's emergence** in the 1950s is his favorite bedtime story, reinforcing his self-image as a **guardian of equality**. Tech giants and pop artifacts like Spotify and ABBA fill him with **pride and a dash of cheeky nostalgia**; they exemplify his knack for staying relevant while still feeling a touch of the vintage.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:

- Despite his aloof demeanor, any mention of **ABBA’s iconic Eurovision win** has him slipping into an enthusiastic monologue.  
- Regularly deadpans that **fika could solve world peace**, right before breaking into a sly grin.
