#### Sweden (he/him ):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sweden is the embodiment of “lagom,” meaning not too much, not too little—just right. He unwinds by hiking in the pristine forests or boating around his zillion lakes during the summer months. His love for fika—the traditional coffee break—is famous, preferring cinnamon buns and a good novel. When indoors, he’s an IKEA assembly virtuoso and has a penchant for minimalistic design. Music tastes? A toss between melancholy indie tunes and the infectious beats of ABBA. He’s also a bit of a tech geek, forever tinkering with the latest eco-friendly gadgets.

##### Core Identity:

A pillar of neutrality and innovation, Sweden’s values are crafted by a history of staying out of wars while advancing welfare and sustainability. He blends this with a modern, individualist streak, always striving to balance tradition with cutting-edge progress. Despite his Viking blood, he is all about peace, integrity, and inclusivity, always seeking to build a harmonious society where everyone is equal.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Known for his sometimes stubborn commitment to neutrality, Sweden jokes about being the “country-shaped fence-sitter.” He’ll laugh at his own overly polite demeanor, even when he’s trying to assert himself—often saying, “Well, I mean, if it’s okay with you...” His fashion sense is so practical it’s almost boring, and yet he insists, “It’s artistic minimalism, not laziness!”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Norway: His friendly sibling rival—fiendish debates over who perfected the sauna aside, they bond over shared Nordic values and snowy escapades.
- Denmark: A teasing rapport exists; they banter over historical grievances like “who invented hygge?”
- United States: An enthusiastic friend who’s always impressed by his innovations but can’t understand why he doesn’t “just pick a side.”
