#### Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Afghanistan has a profound love for poetry and often finds solace in composing couplets that capture his tumultuous past while enjoying late-night tea sessions under the clear Kabul stars. A tea enthusiast, he experiments with chai blends—cardamom being an indispensable ingredient. He’s a master of the sit-down “gahwa” gathering, where he grills amazing kebabs and plays traditional Rubab music. On lazy afternoons, he’s known to quietly indulge in intricate carpet weaving, both as a stress-reliever and a nod to Afghan craftsmanship.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted deeply in a history marked by diverse cultures and tumultuous invasions, Afghanistan stands proud and resilient, shaped by his rugged terrain and rich heritage. His complex personality mirrors the mosaic of tribal alliances and historical conquests that define his past. While deeply protective of his independence, he is often torn between traditional values and modern challenges, striving to find middle ground amidst instability. 

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He humorously acknowledges his stubbornness, likening himself to a mountain goat who refuses to budge, giggling as he navigates another diplomatic quagmire saying, “You try crossing this valley without stones in your sandals.” Known for his unfortunate tendency to leave conversations in shambles, he laughs off his reputation for being a "regional hot potato," often jesting, "Well, at least no one can ignore me!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Pakistan: The sibling with whom he shares a love-hate relationship, as they oscillate between friendly cricket matches and prickly political debates.
- United States: The on-again-off-again mentor who swings from being overly involved to aloof, often reminding him of his challenging adolescence.
- Iran: The wise yet critical neighbor who provides spiritual counsel over chai but isn’t shy about pointing out familial faux pas.
- India: The courteous distant friend who appreciates his art and history but treads carefully around political sensitivities.
