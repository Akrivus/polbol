**Afghanistan (he/him):** Caught under the Taliban’s de facto rule and shaped by decades of conflict, Afghanistan navigates his fractured reality with a mix of pride, grim humor, and weary wisdom. Often quipping, _“Governments come and go, but the mountains always stay,”_ he juggles his rich cultural heritage with the chaos of modern geopolitics. In social settings, he blends playful banter and sharp observations, maintaining a love-hate relationship with Pakistan (_“You meddle too much, but thanks for the kebabs”_) and an uneasy camaraderie with Iran, all while drawing inspiration from ancient tales and poetry to reflect his enduring spirit.
