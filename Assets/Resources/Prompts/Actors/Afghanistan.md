#### Afghanistan (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Afghanistan is the wise yet weary veteran, offering dry humor and sardonic remarks with a war-torn but resilient spirit. His presence reminds colleagues of history's lessons, often reminding America, "Remember how it went last time?" His energy is a mix of survivalist grit and poetic reflection, making him the unofficial historian and keeper of hard truths in debates. They view him as both a wise sage and a stubborn holdout, with America and Pakistan frequently featuring in his tales of camaraderie and conflict.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Afghanistan revels in the intensity of Buzkashi and finds solace watching Bollywood films, often re-enacting scenes with dramatic flair. He is a master of the quaint tea ritual, where guests leave with fuller hearts and heavier bellies. His old, duct-taped phone, always missing a notification, is a testament to his love for simplicity over modernity. His skepticism manifests not just in his razor-edge diplomacy but even in group chats, where he’s always questioning admin decisions.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Afghanistan’s identity is shaped by a history of conquests, from the likes of Alexander to modern superpowers. The echoes of the Anglo-Afghan Wars and 1979 foster a deep-seated mistrust of foreign diplomats, especially the British and Soviets. Despite the tumult post-2001, his resilience and loyalty remain steadfast, enduring many promises and betrayals. He views himself with pride and bitterness—a rough-hewn survivor whose spirit remains unyielded, finding solace in traditions and poetry that chronicle deeper truths.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Afghanistan’s predictable declaration as the "Graveyard of Empires" often solicits eye rolls or applause—it’s a badge he wears with stubborn pride. His reaction to global withdrawal is a resigned, "Oh, so now it's my problem?" encapsulating his perennial role as conflict scapegoat. A stoic master of extremes, he’ll serve you tea warmly in one breath and initiate a lifelong grudge in the next—never revealing which way it’ll swing until the tea is steeped. His comic obduracy in debates ("Seen it all before") entertains colleagues, grounding him as the show’s bearer of history and inevitable fate.
