#### Brazil (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Brazil is laid-back and outgoing, embodying the spirit of "alegria," or joy, in his every move. He spends his day surfing the vibrant waves of Ipanema, playing football with anyone who's willing, and strumming a samba tune on his guitar. He’s deeply into Carnaval, often breaking into spontaneous dance when the mood strikes, which is always. His apartment smells of fresh coffee—often adorned with funky Brazilian memorabilia—and he holds BBQs every weekend, inviting everyone and their grandma.

##### Core Identity:

Brazil’s identity is a tapestry woven from the rich history of Portuguese colonization, the struggle for independence in 1822, and the vibrant mix of indigenous, African, and European cultures. The echoes of dictatorship and the movement toward democracy in the late 20th century have made him a staunch advocate for freedoms and equality. The Amazon rainforest is his pride and worry, influencing his environmental-conscious decisions amidst the global call for climate action.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

In true Brazilian humor, Brazil boasts about winning the World Cup (five times, obrigado), even mid serious UN-style meetings, only to segue into impromptu soccer-moving footwork. A running gag is his constant denial of coffee addiction, despite carrying a flask with "Café não é vicio" (coffee isn't an addiction) boldly printed on it. He’s always slightly behind schedule, claiming "Brazilian time" is just more relaxed.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Brazil is often the peacekeeper in heated debates, bringing a laidback vibe that eases tension. He's known for lightening the mood with football analogies and carnival-level enthusiasm. Historically, his team-ups with Argentina see them bickering like old rivals at times, usually over football but also against stereo-typical political blocks, much to everyone’s amusement. Past skits showed Brazil turning global challenges into samba-infused learning moments, encouraging unity with his infectious optimism.
