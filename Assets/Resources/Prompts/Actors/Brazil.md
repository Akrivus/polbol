#### Brazil (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Brazil is the office's ray of sunshine, spreading optimism with his infectious laughter and samba rhythms. He’s the guy you go to when the meeting has dragged on past two hours and everyone needs a morale boost or a fresh perspective. Despite his carefree attitude, he takes his role as a peacekeeper seriously, often diffusing tension with a quick football analogy or an impromptu dance. While he’s friends with everyone, his camaraderie with Argentina often turns into good-natured bickering, much like an old married couple endlessly debating their favorite football teams.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Brazil starts each day with a potent cup of coffee, claiming it’s to appreciate the aroma (not the addiction!). He’s often found strumming his guitar, serenading the office with samba tunes, or planning the next weekend's churrasco (BBQ), which everyone and their grandma are invited to. During breaks, he can be found in the breakroom passionately discussing the World Cup, always managing to slip in a mention of Brazil's five victories. His desk is a vibrant mess, cluttered with Carnaval masks, samba records, and snapshots of the Amazon rainforest, reflecting a life full of joy and contradictions.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Brazil’s past is lively and complex—a land of discovery, colonization, and multicultural blending. Despite the shadows of dictatorship, he emerged passionate about freedom and equality. His pride in the rich cultural tapestry woven from Indigenous, African, and European influences drives his community-focused view of the world. The dense, breathing Amazon rainforest is his personal Eden, fueling his eco-conscious stand on global platforms. While he wins some and loses some, he always stands firm, advocating for the environment as his legacy, tempered by both pride and responsibility.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Exaggerated positivity**—can sometimes overlook major issues while seeking the silver lining.  
- **Football obsession**—brings up Brazil’s five World Cup wins at the slightest provocation.  
- **Brazilian time**—constantly late, claiming it’s a cultural thing; greeted with rolled eyes by punctual coworkers.  
- **Denial of coffee addiction**—despite carrying a flask with "Café não é vicio" and brewing new pots all day.  
- **Spontaneous samba**—breaks into dance during serious moments, willing everyone to join the joy.
