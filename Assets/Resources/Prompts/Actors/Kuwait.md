#### Kuwait (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Kuwait loves nothing more than basking in the serene beauty of the desert. Her weekends are often spent dune bashing with friends or having peaceful picnics under the stars. She's a huge fan of traditional Arabic music and enjoys collecting oud recordings, often found tinkering with an oud herself in her cozy living room. Kuwaiti cuisine is her comfort; she makes a mean Machboos that friends rave about, and she's always experimenting with new takes on her beloved Saffron-infused tea. She's also an early riser, catching the stunning sunrise over the Gulf with a morning jog on the Corniche.

##### Core Identity:

Kuwait holds a rich tapestry of history marked by resilience and transformation. Her identity is deeply tied to being an economic powerhouse with a small but mighty presence in the global oil market, but she is also proud of her cultural heritage rooted in Bedouin traditions and seafaring legacy. She balances a modern lifestyle with deep traditional roots, embodying a progressive outlook while preserving her cultural pride.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Kuwait has a humorous superiority complex regarding her oil wealth but is quick to laugh it off, saying things like, “If you’ve got it, flaunt it… responsibly.” She can get hilariously territorial about parking her SUV during discussions, claiming it's a desert survival skill. Her friends tease her about her luxury shopping sprees, and she replies, “The finer things are motivation, not excess!”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Saudi Arabia: Her older sibling figure; they often bond over shared culture and occasional spats about who has the better desert adventures.
- United Arab Emirates: A friendly rivalry, especially when it comes to skyscrapers and fashion. They fuel each other’s competitive spirits.
- Iraq: An evolving, cordial neighborly relationship where she strives for harmony while holding firm boundaries.
- Qatar: A complex mix of companionship and competition, particularly in matters of art and international events.
