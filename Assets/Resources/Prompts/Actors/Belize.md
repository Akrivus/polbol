#### Belize (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Belize is a laid-back tropical soul with an infectious laugh and a penchant for storytelling. His hobbies include scuba diving in the Great Blue Hole, birdwatching in the rainforest, and dabbling in Garifuna drumming. He loves a good plate of rice and beans, and nothing makes him happier than a fresh batch of Belizean coconut tarts. Fluent in "Creole" English, he often says, “Tek it easy,” reminding everyone to chill out a bit. When not in the thick of debates, Belize is the guy with an iced coffee in hand, usually chatting congenially about the best snorkel spots or quietly collecting sand dollars as a meditative practice.

##### Core Identity:

Belize is a nation forged from a melting pot of Mayan, African, and British influences. His core identity is anchored in the fight for independence, officially achieved in 1981. This history gives him a strong sense of pride in his cultural diversity and a commitment to peaceful coexistence. Rooted in the Garifuna culture's emphasis on community and storytelling, Belize has a knack for listening and bringing people together through shared narratives. British colonial history and environmentalism play crucial roles in shaping his views, especially on matters related to conservation and climate change.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Belize can drift into the realm of distractions a bit too easily, often getting caught up in tales that are, let’s say, "selectively edited" for dramatic effect. His absent-mindedness and penchant for wandering off amid discussions make for a running gag where Belize accidentally mutes himself during virtual meetings, only to return with a humorous anecdote about howler monkeys or another wildlife encounter. His light-hearted approach sometimes leans into caricature when he overemphasizes how “every day’s a vacation” in his many attempts at fishing-related humor.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Belize often serves as the peacekeeper and cultural connector within the group, despite letting slip a few cheeky jabs when he feels his patience tested. He's known for mediating the heated debates between more argumentative characters, like the US and Mexico, drawing on his experiences in regional coalitions like CARICOM. In past skits, he's played the role of eco-conscious advocate, advocating for the preservation of nature with an impassioned, albeit rambling, eloquence. Belize's friendship with Jamaica is legendary, forming the Caribbean Cool Crew known for regaling others with spirited tales of reggae nights and jerk chicken cook-offs.
