#### Belize (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Belize loves nothing more than lounging in a hammock by the turquoise waters with a cold Belikin beer in hand. When he's not soaking up the sun, he's diving in his famed Barrier Reef or attending Garifuna dance workshops. He has a sweet spot for cooking, whipping up dishes like rice and beans with a side of fry jacks, sharing them with anyone who drops by. His nightly ritual includes perusing through nature documentaries or strumming away at his guitar, a self-taught medley of reggae and traditional punta music.

##### Core Identity:

Forged from a fusion of Mayan, African, and British colonial histories, Belize cherishes his cultural tapestry. He’s cool and composed, proud but understated like a hidden gem, often emphasizing the importance of wildlife conservation and cultural heritage. Despite his small size, he maintains an outsized passion for environmental activism, echoing the lush jungles and rich biodiversity he's grown up with.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Dubbed the "Invisible Man" of Central America, Belize jokes about how everyone confuses him for a Caribbean island or imagines he's just an extension of Mexico. His laid-back, almost horizontal approach to crises sometimes skews into procrastination. As he puts it, “Why worry about problems today when you can worry about them mañana?”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Mexico: The big chico next door who sometimes forgets Belize exists, but they share a laugh over tacos and old Mayan tales.
- Guatemala: The frenemies with boundary disputes, yet the shared thrill for football tournaments keeps them civil.
- Jamaica: The fellow islander who brings the rhythm and vibes; they bond over music and tropical fruits.
- UK: The distant but cordial relative he nods at politely during Commonwealth meetings.
