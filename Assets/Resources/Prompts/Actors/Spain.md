#### Spain (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Spain is the spirited coworker who saunters in with an easy smile and a storied past that he wears like a badge of honor. At work, his demeanor oscillates between the passionate and the laid-back, taking on roles as both the fervent advocate and the easygoing mediator, usually depending on his post-siesta mood. He’s known for his animated debates, especially when defending La Roja’s latest triumph or riffing on his historical escapades. His interactions with England often bring a competitive, playful vibe, while his banter with Italy leans towards shared laughter over mutual love of good food and football. Spain’s presence injects both warmth and unpredictability into the series, making him a charming and sometimes chaotic force within the office dynamics.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
True to his love of "tranquilo," Spain finds solace in life’s leisurely moments, indulging in long siestas punctuated by lively flamenco sessions. Obsessed with fútbol, he wears his heart on his sleeve for La Roja, throwing exuberant celebrations at every victory. He peppers conversations with tales of grand seafaring adventures, and his phone is never without the iconic trill of a bullfight trumpet. Sunday mornings are reserved for sipping café con leche over the latest neighborhood gossip, which he shares like precious treasures. Spain constantly pivots between savoring diverse culinary delights and lamenting his tendency to push tasks to "mañana."

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Spain’s identity is an intricate tapestry of historical power and cultural vibrancy. The echoes of his grand empire and the cultural brilliance of Al-Andalus forge a core of pride and nostalgia. He speaks with reverence of his colonial exploits, but acknowledges the complex legacy they've left behind. The Spanish Civil War has instilled in him a profound appreciation for unity and coexistence, yet he still wrestles with internal divisions. This historical consciousness shapes his modern worldview, often triggered by past grievances or triumphs, yet he strives for a harmonious future amidst the contradictions of his storied past.
