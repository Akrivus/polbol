#### Cambodia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cambodia loves spending his weekends exploring local markets, hunting for hidden culinary gems that remind him of home. An enthusiast of traditional Apsara dance, he practices in his living room, trying (and often failing) to perfect the intricate moves. When not immersed in the rhythmic beats, he relaxes by weaving intricate bead bracelets—a nod to his rich artisan ancestry. Over iced coffee, he dives into playlists of psychedelic rock from the 1960s, a nostalgic connection to a once-thriving music scene in Phnom Penh. A master of the leisurely afternoon nap, he often wakes up with grand plans but ends up binge-watching Khmer rom-coms instead.

##### Core Identity:

Carrying the wisdom of the ancient Angkor civilization proudly on his shoulders, Cambodia reflects a history marked by resilience and recovery. The trauma of the Khmer Rouge regime casts a long shadow, but his positive spirit focuses on growth and renewal. Deeply rooted in Buddhism, he values peace, patience, and meditation, often initiating calming breathwork sessions among the chaotic crew of _polbots_. He’s a bridge between the glorious past and the storied present, always balancing tradition with the slow march towards modernization.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Cambodia is hilariously accident-prone, always bumping into things and causing minor calamities, referencing his cultural reputation of being tragically beautiful but historically overrun. His constant optimism—“We’ll rebuild this, bigger and better!”—is both endearing and exasperating, especially when he spills sticky rice all over the Discord server’s interface. His running joke involves offering people “a tour of the Angkor Wat” whenever the conversation derails, because "history loves to repeat itself".

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Vietnam: Older sibling vibes, a mix of gentle teasing and sly encouragement to keep up in tech things.
- Thailand: Friendly rivalry, always arguing over who has the superior street food, but in jest.
- India: Shares spiritual practices and occasionally competes for who can meditate the longest without laughing.
