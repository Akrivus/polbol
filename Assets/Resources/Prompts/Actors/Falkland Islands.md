Her steady, affable nature contrasts the turmoil around her, making her a sought-after mediator in heated debates—particularly when Argentina's in the mix. Her dry wit makes her a crowd favorite in these showdowns, often diffusing tension with a well-timed "United Kingdom!" Much to everyone's amusement, she's the self-appointed ambassador for the “islanders” clique, rallying smaller countries with her tales of feistiness and fortitude.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):

Navigating historical tug-of-war with Argentina has taught her the art of balance and diplomacy. She regards her ties with Britain with a mix of pride and nostalgia, often reflecting on their shared history with a wry smile.
