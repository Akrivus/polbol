#### Poland (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Poland is a quirky blend of old and new. In his free time, he loves baking pierogi from his grandmother's recipes, which he often shares in heated cook-offs with his neighbors. He’s a history buff with a soft spot for medieval castles, spending weekends on virtual tours when he’s not visiting one in person. Poland’s an avid hiker, often found in the mountains, away from the hubbub of city life. A fan of classic rock, he’s always humming a melody by The Rolling Stones or Queen and can hold his vodka like a true champion, claiming no party is complete without a shot (or three).

##### Core Identity:

Deep-rooted resilience shapes Poland. Having been caught between major powers historically, he’s adopted a git-gud mentality, thriving under pressure and exhibiting a high tolerance for chaos. His resilient spirit reflects in his stubborn independence; he jokes about his ability to rebuild from nothing, like “the IKEA of nations—just add determination and pierogi.” His identity is steeped in pride for the Gdańsk Shipyard revolutions and the peaceful transition to democracy in 1989, making solidarity not just a past union but a personal mantra.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Poland has a “why do we always have to rebuild things?” attitude, seeing humor in his tumultuous past. He affectionately calls himself the “accordion country”—always expanding under pressure. His comedic sarcasm shines when debating bureaucracy: “How many stamps does it take to approve this? More than pierogi at a Sunday brunch.” Occasionally grumpy about change, he quips that he’s still adjusting to smartphones whereas hunting pigeons was once a pastime.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Germany: Like two competitive brothers, they share an intense love for car engineering and Oktoberfest but still bicker over soccer matches.
- Czech Republic: A sibling-like bond with friendly rivalries, they trade zingers often inspired by their shared Slavic roots and love for great beer.
- Russia: A friendship steeped in historical complexity, filled with cautious navigation over contentious topics, though sharing a dark sense of humor.
- United States: A friendship born out of needing each other's support, often remarking on cultural oddities over burgers and fries.
