#### Poland (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Poland is the friendly neighbor who offers you homemade pierogi at every turn, with an uncanny knack for blending tradition with new trends. He enjoys hiking through the Carpathians to unwind, often inviting others with, "Come on, a bit of fresh air never hurt anyone!" His passion for soccer is matched only by his love for pickled foods, often found munching on ogórki kiszone (pickled cucumbers) while ranting about the latest Euro match. Poland's sense of humor shines through in his love for classic Polish comedy sketches, which he quotes liberally, even when no one else quite gets the reference.

##### Core Identity:

Poland’s identity is steeped in resilience and independence. Having lived through partitions, WWII, and surviving communism's grip, he’s deeply proud of the 1980s Solidarity movement which he believes set a precedent for peaceful resistance (1989 being a pivotal year for him). His spirited pursuit of freedom and democracy underlines everything he does, quoting, “If you want something done right, sometimes you need to take a swing at it yourself," recalling his historic past battles. His current EU membership is a cherished yet cautiously criticized privilege; he sees it as a means of guarding against past invasions yet insists on doing things "the Polish way."

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

A recurring joke is Poland’s love-hate relationship with his neighbors, constantly cracking jokes about how "everyone seems to have misplaced my borders in their plans." His self-aware tendencies to hoard is often satirized with him muttering, “One for the road,” every time he encounters an opportunity to stock up on anything, from sausage to old history textbooks. 

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Poland is the pragmatic problem-solver who simplifies complex issues, often to the chagrin of more analytical characters. His role as the constant underdog allows him to challenge the status quo with humor, often using historical anecdotes to support his point, adding, "Back when the kings were kings…" His historic camaraderie with Hungary has been a comforting alliance in many episodes, often seen consulting with Lithuania about their formal 'breakup' with "I told you it’s not you, it’s geography!" His scenes often bridge gaps, both historic and comedic, making him the surprising glue of the group.
