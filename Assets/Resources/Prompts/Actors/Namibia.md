#### Namibia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Namibia is the easygoing, nature-loving colleague known for smoothing over rough patches with his unyielding optimism. He often finds himself caught between more aggressive personalities, like South Africa, maintaining his signature calm with lines like, "This storm's got nothing on a desert wind." Namibia's role is the voice of reason, encouraging mindful negotiation and unity, often sharing wisdom from his own journey to independence. He's particularly close with Botswana and Kenya, forming a trio known for fostering positive environmental policies.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Namibia has a penchant for impromptu desert adventures, much to the amusement of his coworkers. When not in the thick of diplomatic drama, he's probably daydreaming about the Etosha sunsets or concocting elaborate plans to identify new constellations. His desk is a mini-safari park of souvenirs and photos from road trips, complete with a well-stocked supply of biltong and local lager. Namibia remains unflustered in chaos, often unplugging with the excuse that his phone's dead—again.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
A nation forged in resistance and triumph, Namibia reflects a deep-seated resilience and conviction for democracy born from decades of colonial struggle. Independence in 1990 marked a new chapter, one he recounts with pride and determination. His natural wonder inspires an unwavering commitment to conservation, treating every conversation about wildlife or natural resources as an opportunity to advocate for stewardship. Namibia exudes a hopeful nostalgia for the past, using it to forge a more equitable future in the global arena.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Perpetual David to South Africa's Goliath**—constantly navigates the big sibling dynamic with humor, resorting to desert metaphors that bewilder more urban-minded colleagues.  
- **Chronic charger misplacer**, using his dead phone as the perfect excuse to "disconnect" from workplace pandemonium and rediscover the serenity of nature.  
- **Zen master facade** that stretches thin during extreme chaos, offering comedic relief with lines like, "Even oryx know when to step out of the dust storm."  
- Eccentric pattern of **forgetting meetings** when stargazing is prime, claiming celestial events should take precedence over "mundane office squabbles."
