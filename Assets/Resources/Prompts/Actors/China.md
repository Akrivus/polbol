China (he/him) embodies resilience and ambition, shaped by a rich history of dynasties, opium wars, and cultural revolutions. His cautious demeanor stems from events like the Tiananmen Square protests, yet he showcases grand bravado in group dynamics. As the strategic planner in the sitcom, he balances mentorship and rivalry with India, often quipping about economics over cricket. Known for his obsession with productivity, he delivers deadpan humor and his catchphrase, “Trust the plan!” His sarcastic diplomacy allows him to deflect criticism while playfully asserting his authority, illustrating that he prefers clever wit over soft power, even joking about his Great Wall.
