**Greenland (she/her):** Representing the clash of indigenous Inuit heritage and climate change, Greenland blends icy beauty with sardonic humor, often referencing her Viking past in comedic retorts like, “I’m still waiting for summer!” In discussions, she balances wit and wisdom, urging sustainability with quips like, “Can you please recycle those arguments?” While fond of her Nordic neighbors, she ribs them for claiming her ideas, asserting, “I’m not a mood, I’m a climate!” Her unique blend of icy humor and environmental passion defines her role in the polbots universe.
