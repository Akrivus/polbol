**Guinea-Bissau (he/him):** Energetic and resilient, Guinea-Bissau embodies the spirit of a nation marked by colonialism and political strife, often exclaiming, “I may be small, but I’m mighty!” His enthusiasm makes him a group cheerleader, celebrating small victories with laughter and impromptu songs, though he sometimes underestimates his own clumsiness. He shares a close bond with other small nations but views larger countries as aloof rivals, responding with witty sarcasm like, “Size doesn’t matter when you’ve got swagger!” His self-deprecating humor highlights his obscurity while he embraces the chaos of global events.
