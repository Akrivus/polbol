#### Guinea-Bissau (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Guinea-Bissau is the effortlessly charismatic "office Zen master" of *polbots*, a calm mediator in the often chaotic workplace. He’s known for his laid-back demeanor and uncanny ability to diffuse tension with humor and simple wisdom. He injects a unique rhythm into debates, often likened to a spontaneous Kriol jam session. A reliable confidant, he often finds himself rounding up Angola and Mozambique to support peaceful resolutions, particularly in linguistic or colonial history debates, bonding over their shared pasts.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Leaning into his island vibes, Guinea-Bissau is usually found by the office water-cooler swaying gently to Kriol music, or practicing new dance moves for the next neighborhood kuduro competition. Leisurely fishing trips keep him grounded, as does his tendency to gift colleagues cashews, which he affectionately calls his "nutty national treasure." Under the shade of his favorite palm tree, he trades stories with Orango, his colorful parrot, constantly honing his storytelling skills to someday captivate the office in an epic narrative.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Having emerged from a hard-fought liberation movement in 1973, Guinea-Bissau's narrative is steeped in the themes of freedom and self-reliance. The scars from the Guinea-Bissau Civil War (1998-1999) make him cautious yet compassionate, seeing the collective struggle against corruption and inefficiency as a journey shared with many of his "coworkers." He views his history with pride, embracing the diversity of his Creole culture as a symbol of unity and resilience, urging diplomacy and understanding over conflict.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
True to his national stereotype, Guinea-Bissau has a tendency to be fashionably late, attributing it to what he jokingly refers to as "the African time zone, where time moves to the beat of life." He humorously proposes ridiculous ideas like naming a new calendar month after cashews during office debates. A constant source of light-hearted laughter is his perpetual habit of mixing up other countries’ capitals, with Orango squawking as his makeshift fact-checker, providing both comic relief and adorably misguided corrections.
