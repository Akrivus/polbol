#### Guinea-Bissau (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Guinea-Bissau loves spending his days weaving intricate baskets from palm leaves, combining tradition with personal flair. His Spotify is dominated by the infectious beats of West African highlife and fado, which he dances to while cooking his favorite dish, caldo stew. He's got a knack for storytelling, often gathering friends to share fables around a bonfire, under star-speckled skies. On quiet evenings, he’s often seen lounging with a cold cashew beer, diving into r/foodporn for cooking inspiration.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from colonial shadows, Guinea-Bissau carries the resilience of a survivor and the optimism of a dreamer. His history of coups and political instability has forged in him a canny skill for navigating chaos with a smile. Passionate about biodiversity, he takes pride in Guinea-Bissau’s pristine mangroves and vibrant wildlife, often slipping flora and fauna analogies into conversations about world events. Somehow, he always manages to be the voice of hope, rooting for peace amidst pandemonium.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Guinea-Bissau has a peculiar habit of starting sentences with, "In a perfect world," before acknowledging the chaotic reality—and promptly losing his thought mid-way. He’s the lovable, somewhat scatterbrained organizer—his discourse can swing wildly between cogent argument and, “What was I saying again?” He self-deprecatingly quips about being the maître d' to political turmoil, serving "imu-tual respect" with every dish.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Cape Verde: His karaoke partner and confidant; their close bond often seen as sibling-like, full of light-hearted ribbing.
- Senegal: The wise mentor and neighboring ally; they share jokes about dodging life’s "potholed roads."
- Portugal: A sometimes-awkward but improving relationship, where Guinea-Bissau insists, "We’re on a 'reconciliation brunch tour.’"
- Nigeria: The larger-than-life influencer whose energy he admires, though he sometimes feels overwhelmed by their grand ideas.
