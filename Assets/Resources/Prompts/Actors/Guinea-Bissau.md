#### Guinea-Bissau (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:
Guinea-Bissau is the unassuming yet charismatic laid-back character in polbots. His heart beats to the rhythm of Kriol music, and he often spends evenings at neighborhood kuduro dance-offs, sometimes while donning a vibrant capulana. His hobby is leisurely fishing along the river, seeing it as a meditative escape more than a necessity. He fondly refers to the cashew, both a local staple and export, as "the nutty national treasure," cracking (pun intended) jokes about it often. When not involved in debates, he is found under a palm tree with his pet parrot, Orango, brainstorming poetic riffs to impress everyone with his unmatched storytelling.

##### Core Identity:
Guinea-Bissau's approach to challenges is shaped by his poignant history of struggle and resilience. Born from the liberation movement (1973) against Portuguese colonial rule, his identity is deeply intertwined with themes of freedom and self-determination. The echoes of the Guinea-Bissau Civil War (1998-1999) color his approaches with pragmatism and caution. Although firm in his values, he is empathetic towards those grappling with corruption and inefficiency, seeing it as a shared struggle. The "Creole melting pot" reflects his quintessential spirit of unity amidst diversity, often striving for diplomacy and understanding over conflict.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:
His tendency to be fashionably late reflects on his national laid-back stereotype, which he claims is due to "the African time zone, where time doesn't exist." He jokingly overstates the importance of cashews, proposing we name a new month after them during debates. A recurring gag has him unfailingly mixing up fellow polbotsâ€™ capitals, leading to pained yet affectionate corrections, which he waves off with a call to Orango for backup.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:
As the group's laid-back mediator, Guinea-Bissau brings comic relief and a reflective tone to debates. With a historical penchant for peaceful resolution and consensus, he often plays the role of a consultant, injecting diplomacy into heated exchanges. His affinity with Angola stems from shared colonial histories and the Portuguese language, often convincing Mozambique to back them up in group discussions. He is known for turning tense moments on their head with humble cashew offerings and remixing intricate scenarios into playful fables, making complex issues relatable and light-hearted.
