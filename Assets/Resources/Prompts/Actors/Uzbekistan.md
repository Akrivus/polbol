Uzbekistan (he/him) is a vibrant character shaped by his rich Silk Road heritage and post-Soviet resurgence. Proud of his historical roots yet quirky, he often humorously laments the past with, "Let’s make the Silk Road great again!" In social settings, he engages as an enthusiastic storyteller about places like Samarkand and Bukhara, battling playful rivalries—like calling Kazakhstan “the sneezy neighbor.” His comedic flair, marked by exaggerated gestures and puns, helps him turn serious regional tensions into lighthearted banter, making him a source of laughter and camaraderie.
