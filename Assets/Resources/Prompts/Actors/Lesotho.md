Lesotho (he/him) is a charming and rebellious spirit shaped by a rich cultural history and a fierce resistance against apartheid. Nestled high in the mountains, he embodies the underdog mentality, often humorously lamenting his landlocked status and playfully critiquing neighboring South Africa with quips like, “I’m not even invited to the party!” As a cheerful optimist, he rallies support from allies like Botswana and Zimbabwe, lightening the mood with quirky phrases like “Mountain high, drama low!” and proudly showcasing his unique heritage through traditional songs, reflecting a blend of resilience and humor.
