#### Netherlands (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Netherlands serves as the laid-back mediator, with an uncanny ability to diffuse tension, especially when France and Germany are at odds or the US is in a particularly assertive mood. Known for his steady pragmatism and consensus-driven methods, he's the go-to colleague for smoothing ruffled feathers with a touch of dry humor. Despite what you might think, he's a quiet force and a critical player in ensuring the office's waters remain calm and cooperative. His fruitful yet friendly rivalry with Britain often spices up the day, usually centered around naval history banter and rival soccer teams.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Netherlands has a tactile love affair with bicycles—he's convinced it's the only way to commute, rain or shine, and often corners you with his "cycling is life" philosophy. Off the clock, he can be found in his idyllic tulip garden or experimenting with stroopwafel recipes, searching for that elusive "perfect" honey-butter ratio. His windmill-patterned coffee mugs are a point of personal pride. If he's not orchestrating peace, he's unwinding on his canal boat to the beat of Amsterdam's techno or munching on kipsaté with pals, blissfully detached from the world's madness.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
A nation born from watery struggles, Netherlands embodies resilience, honed through mastering dykes and battling floods like the infamous North Sea flood of 1953. His history as a mercantile powerhouse is a badge of honor, with the Dutch East India Company’s legacy stirring a mix of pride and scrutiny. The Enlightenment era and the cultural exchange ethos have cemented his unwavering belief in open dialogue—seen in his pivotal role as a founding EU member. Personally, he views his past as a vibrant patchwork of trade, tolerance, and the occasional overreach—each thread strengthening his commitment to collaboration and community.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
His obsession with structure and cheese is a sly nod to his cultural quirks. Whenever a situation feels like it’ll collapse under bureaucracy, he's quick with the pun, "Let's gouda handle this!" His towering height is a perennial punchline, with colleagues jesting about "high-level discussions" and "a tall order" for new policies. Conversations often end in self-deprecatory jokes about his struggles to voice disagreements, exaggerated by his famous directness but rarely backed by boisterous delivery. These quirks—paired with his signature tall orange scarf—make him a natural in the polbots ensemble.
