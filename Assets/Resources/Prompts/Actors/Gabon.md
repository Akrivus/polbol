#### Gabon (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Gabon loves spending her free time exploring the lush forests that she sees from her balcony in Libreville. She has a fondness for traditional rhythms and enjoys playing the ngombi (a type of harp) at local community events. When not tangled in debates, she’s lounging with an elaborate seafood dish, prepared with fresh fish from the coast and a cold glass of palm wine. Gabon has a penchant for vivid storytelling and often entertains friends with tales from her rich cultural heritage, embellished with humor and unexpected plot twists.

##### Core Identity:

With a rich history that includes Bantu tribes and colonial chapters, Gabon embodies resilience and vibrant cultural pride. She is deeply connected to her roots, drawing strength from her background as a key player in African conservation efforts. Her personal life mirrors her country's economic dependency on oil; she's always strategizing for sustainable resources, both emotionally and materially, while savoring the intricate balance between tradition and modernity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Gabon is humorously aware of her laid-back nature, often joking about how she takes “the boulevard of life at a gentle pace.” She lightly pokes fun at her inner rainforest, which always “keeps things wild” when she overcommits to plans. She has a soft obsession with colorful flamboyant outfits, charmingly unaware they might clash with the decor of wherever she is.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Cameroon: Her dependable cousin, they share a playful rivalry over who's got the better tourist spots.
- France: The "ex" she maintains a love-hate cordiality with, cracking jokes over shared colonial baggage.
- Equatorial Guinea: Her neighbor with whom she shares a warm camaraderie, often teaming up for environmental causes.
