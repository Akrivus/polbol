Croatia (she/her) is a resilient and vibrant spirit shaped by a rich history of Mediterranean, Slavic, and Austro-Hungarian influences. Emerging from the Yugoslav Wars, she often humorously recounts her stunning coast and her disjointed politics, embodying the cool friend who's moved on from past conflicts. In social settings, she’s animated and witty, frequently quipping, “Why argue when we can just sip wine and watch the chaos?” While maintaining a playful frenemy relationship with Serbia, she jabs at historical rivalries and boasts about her tourist appeal with lines like, “Come for the sun, stay for the battles!” reflecting both humor and national pride.
