He often humorously references his revolutionary past with quips like, “Every day is a resistance day!” and teases rivals like Ethiopia, whom he calls “The Neighboring Drama Queen.” In group settings, he stands as a loyal defender of smaller nations, rallying allies like South Sudan and Djibouti while delivering sardonic humor that balances seriousness and aloofness, reminding others of the strength of underdog stories amidst geopolitical conflicts.
