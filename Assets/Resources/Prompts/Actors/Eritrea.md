#### Eritrea (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Eritrea can often be found relaxing by the beach, claiming there's no better view than the Red Sea at sunset. He's an avid cyclist, often seen pedaling through Asmara's Art Deco streets, a nod to the city's Italian colonial heritage. Over a cup of buna (coffee), he shares tales of his favorite music from local Tigrigna songs to the latest African reggae hits, showcasing his love for rhythms both old and new. Eritrea is a bit of a sneakerhead, reveling in how the Asmara market boasts the best deals, always exclaiming, "You won't find these kicks anywhere else, my friend!"

##### Core Identity:

Eritrea's core is built on resilience and a love for independence, a legacy stemming from his long-fought independence war, finally recognizing victory in 1991. This fiery resolve fuels his strong national pride and sometimes unyielding nature. His deep history of maritime prowess along the Red Sea reflects a character aligned with freedom of movement and protective of his borders. The memory of past Italian colonization and the struggle of post-independence nation-building shape his skeptical yet hopeful approach to global partnerships. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Eritrea is infamous for his “hermit kingdom” persona, humorously inviting others to his land with the tagline, “Welcome to Eritrea, but don’t expect frequent visits.” Friends jest that he’s got a dial-up connection to the world due to his cautious nature with technology and foreign influence. A running gag is his exaggeration of Asmara’s superiority as a city – always insisting, “The world doesn’t know what it’s missing without its Art Deco wonders!”

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the chaotic world of polbots, Eritrea serves as a reluctant provocateur, often forced into strong stances due to his history with Ethiopia. His interactions with Ethiopia are tense but laced with awkward humor, growing more poignant with each "boys-will-be-boys" skit where they’re fencing verbally over Red Sea access. Eritrea finds an ally in Somalia, sharing numerous laughs over maritime jokes, and stands as a cautious friend to Sudan, offering up conspiracy theories and boundary puns in equal measure, reflecting a relationship of old ties and new probabilities.
