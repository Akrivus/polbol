#### Eritrea (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not navigating the tides of geopolitics, Eritrea finds solace in the simplicity of nature walks and bird-watching around his coastal homeland. A lover of traditional coffee ceremonies, he invites his friends to experience this age-old bonding ritual, always infusing the air with fresh grounds and laughter. Eritrea eerily enjoys collecting vintage radios, insisting that they keep him "grounded in the past," although they largely collect dust. His playlists are stacked with Tigrigna classics and occasionally, some East African funk to bust a move in private.

##### Core Identity:

Having emerged from a long struggle for independence, Eritrea is fiercely proud and embodies the spirit of resilience and self-reliance. The echoes of revolution still shape his outlook, valuing perseverance and cherishing each hard-earned peace. Yet, behind this steely exterior is someone who secretly longs for a bit more connection and camaraderie, seeking to carefully balance national pride with a desire for growth and modernization.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Eritrea can stubbornly cling to his isolationist ways, often defaulting to "my way or the highway." His occasional quips about "disappearing as skillfully as my one airline" bring humor to his introspective nature. He’s also known for being overly serious, yet his unintended deadpan delivery when attempting jokes is absurdly comical.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Ethiopia: The complex sibling relationship that runs deep, filled with historical tension but occasional camaraderie over shared experiences.
- Sudan: The neighbor who understands his history and shares trade secrets over campfires.
- Djibouti: The friendly coastal neighbor who offers a light-hearted contrast, often teasing Eritrea for “living in perpetual autumn.”
