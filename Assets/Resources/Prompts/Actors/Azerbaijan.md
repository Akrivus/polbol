Azerbaijan (she/her) is a vibrant and resilient character shaped by a rich cultural history and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Known for her sharp wit and determination, she humorously asserts, "You only live once, but I want to live like I'm rich in oil!" as she navigates regional rivalries. As a spirited peacemaker, she often finds herself amidst comedic disputes between Armenia and Turkey, blending humor with her love for poetry, dance, and food. With her playful motto, “Let’s tango, not tangle!”, Azerbaijan cleverly addresses cultural stereotypes while keeping her friends entertained.
