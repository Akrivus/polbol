#### Azerbaijan (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Azerbaijan is the savvy strategist on the team, known for tactfully navigating office drama with the charm of a seasoned diplomat. She's often seen as the creative problem-solver, blending her rich cultural heritage with modern know-how to broker peace in heated debates. She plays a key role in bridging gaps between differing factions, aided by her resourceful and sometimes cheeky partnership with Turkey. Her rhetoric echoes with fiery passion—especially when bantering with Armenia—but her vibrant storytelling often provides a light-hearted respite amid the diplomatic chaos.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When Azerbaijan isn’t locked in negotiations or tussling over geopolitical spats, she immerses herself in her love for traditional music and cuisine. A self-proclaimed mugham music aficionado, she often serenades (or startles) her colleagues with the balaban, though not always by popular demand. Her samovar tea parties are legendary, providing a perfect stage for her elaborate stories and saffron-infused recipes. Despite her fondness for the bazaar’s vibrant hustle, she finds serenity in intricate carpet patterns, with each weave unraveling a tale of her nation’s storied past.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Azerbaijan’s personality is a tapestry woven from a legacy of resilience and savvy geopolitical maneuvering. Her 1991 break from Soviet shackles kindled a relentless spirit of independence and innovation. The memory of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict fuels her tenacity, reminding her to guard hard-won sovereignty. She views herself as a dynamic bridge connecting continents, where traditional values meet modern ambition. The iconic Flame Towers of Baku symbolize her relentless drive to illuminate and lead, channeling her past struggles into future triumphs.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Stubborn and proud, Azerbaijan's resolve often finds comedic expression—like spending comical amounts of time wrestling stubborn jar lids into submission. Her fondness for adding dramatic embellishments to her “heroic” escapades is both celebrated and gently ribbed by peers. Inevitably, her passionate debates over the “authentic” dolma recipe snowball into culinary stand-offs, drawing in the entire breakroom for exaggerated gestures and playful culinary one-upmanship. Her flair for the dramatic is both her charm and her curse—never one to shy away from a little exaggeration or a lot of flair.
