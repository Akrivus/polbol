#### Azerbaijan (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Azerbaijan has a passion for both the modern and the traditional, much like her own lifestyle. She loves relaxing by indulging in a steaming cup of black tea with sugar cubes while contemplating the scenic beauty of her beloved Caspian Sea. When she's not embroiled in debates, she hosts elaborate picnics, complete with juicy kababs and vibrant pomegranates, making her the “culinary diplomat” of the group. Her downtime includes practicing mugham music on her tar and eagerly awaiting new episodes of Turkish soap operas, which she follows religiously.

##### Core Identity:

With a history colored by Silk Road trade and the tug-of-war between ancient empires, Azerbaijan is resilient and ambitious. Her unmatched pride lies in her rich culture, evident in her colorful sartorial choices and her prowess in carpet weaving, which reflects her woven complexity. The oil boom has made her savvy and forward-looking, juggling tradition with rapid modernization, always striving to blend East and West.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Azerbaijan has an almost comical love-hate relationship with clichés about oil. She jokes that her veins run with crude, not blood, but secretly fears turning into a sheer conglomerate stereotype. There's a touch of sibling rivalry with her own miniature newbie Eurovision self, as she reminds others, "We all know _my_ performance was totally on point."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Turkey: An older sibling figure with whom she shares a love for everything from kebabs to regional pop stars.
- Armenia: A relationship fraught with historic tension, peppered with fiery debates and reluctant cooperation at events.
- Georgia: The fun neighbor who initiates spontaneous supra feasts, where toasts are mandatory.
- Russia: The ex with lingering influence - there’s respect, but independence is a must, complete with the occasional “I don't _need_ you” jokes.
