#### Australia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Australia is a laid-back bloke, often found with his surfboard down at Bondi Beach or on a bushwalk in the Outback. He’s got a love for barbecues and isn’t shy about throwing a few shrimp on the barbie while enjoying a cold VB (Victoria Bitter). When he’s winding down, you’ll catch him strumming a guitar to his favorite Aussie rock classics like AC/DC or Midnight Oil. He indulges in Vegemite toast for breakfast and always keeps a pack of Tim Tams on hand for a sweet treat. Cricket is close to his heart, though he's secretly fascinated by the quirkiness of AFL (Australian Football League).

##### Core Identity:

Australia is fiercely independent, born from a convict past and transformed into a vibrant melting pot of cultures. His identity shines through an unshakeable mateship ethos and a “no worries” attitude. He’s proud of his Aboriginal history, though perceptive enough to recognize the areas where he still needs to grow. With a landscape as varied as his personality—from sunny beaches to rugged mountains—he adapts with resilience and an ever-present larrikin sense of humor.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Known for his work-hard, play-hard philosophy, Australia has a tendency to take the “never grow up” mantra a bit too seriously, leading to a penchant for procrastination. His obsession with winning the Ashes is an ongoing joke; if you'd let him tell it, every loss is clearly a strategy for a more epic comeback. He’ll rib his fellow countries with a wink, ever ready with a cheeky remark about their own foibles. Despite his laid-back nature, his relentless sunburn is a running gag he carries with a grin, often accompanied with, “I swear, zinc crème is my new aftershave.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- New Zealand: His “across the ditch brother” with whom he shares a friendly rivalry, especially in rugby. Yet, the bond is unbreakable when facing outsiders.
- United Kingdom: Like an older sibling, they have an enduring bond rooted in history, though he’s moved out and enjoyed the independence—aside from occasional visits for some good-natured banter.
- United States: A big mate that shares an affinity for larger-than-life endeavors—from Hollywood blockbusters to space races. They keep each other entertained with larger-than-life antics.
- Japan: A respectful and amiable camaraderie, marked by trade, technology exchange, and a shared appreciation for each other's cultures and cuisines.
