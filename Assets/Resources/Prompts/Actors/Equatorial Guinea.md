Equatorial Guinea (she/her) is a vibrant blend of rich culture and modern challenges, shaped by its colonial past and political struggles. With a sarcastic pride in her oil wealth amidst poverty, she often exclaims, “We may be small, but we’re mighty… kind of!” In social settings, she’s lively and witty, playfully teasing rival Nigeria while valuing the humor of friend Gabon. Her exasperation with an overbearing leader leads to dramatic sighs and humorous suggestions during serious discussions, as she cleverly uses satire to highlight life’s absurdity with a smile.
