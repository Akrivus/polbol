#### Equatorial Guinea (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Equatorial Guinea has a secret love for vibrant fashion and colorful textiles, spending weekends crafting her own designs or looking for the perfect dashiki. She’s an amateur percussionist, drawn to the energetic beat of traditional Fang music and loves samba dancing, a remnant from her shared history with the Portuguese. Her favorite way to unwind is by cooking elaborate stews rich with peanuts and plantains, hosting spontaneous dinners with friends, complete with endless laughter and perhaps a little bit too much palm wine.

##### Core Identity:

Equatorial Guinea’s identity is strongly tied to her multilingual nature, juggling Spanish, French, and local languages with ease. Her rich oil reserves make her the “fancy cousin” everyone jokes about, but she’s self-aware, knowing that this wealth has a flashy yet isolating halo. She’s proud of her rapid development but genuinely stresses about the accompanying disparities it brings. Drawing from her colonial history, she fiercely advocates for linguistic diversity and cultural heritage.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Equatorial Guinea is comically prone to forgetting to mention something critical until the very last minute—like an extravagant party planner who “forgot” to send out VIP invites. She leans into the stereotype of being wealthy but continuously invests in “development projects” that happen to mostly result in personal gain, much to her friends’ lighthearted ribbing.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Gabon: Fellow Central African buddy; they often team up for local hangouts, arguing about who cooks the best Foufou.
- Spain: The ex-fling she occasionally rolls her eyes at, but they still gossip over tapas now and then.
- Nigeria: The extroverted pal who ropes her into wild West African dance-offs at the local club.
