#### Austria (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Austria has a particular fondness for classical music, often found humming Mozart while meticulously organizing his impressive collection of vintage records. He's a passionate skier, spending winter weekends on the slopes, and enjoys peaceful hikes in the Alps during summer. His love for schnitzel and Sachertorte is unmatched, and he insists on making the best Wiener schnitzel this side of the Danube. A habit of his is sipping a Melange coffee along with a hearty dose of r/Austria which keeps him grounded to his roots while taking breaks from his formal demeanor.

##### Core Identity:

With deep roots in a once-mighty empire, Austria carries a dignified air of old-world charm, often reflecting on history over a glass of Grüner Veltliner. Balancing an appreciation for grand cultural heritage with a pragmatic approach, he's deeply proud of maintaining neutrality and being a bridge in European politics. Yet, he often rolls his eyes at his own tendency to romanticize a past filled with concert halls and imperial balls, focusing instead on being a peaceful mediator.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Austria quips about his ‘boomer’ tendencies, such as preferring letter writing over emails ("there’s an art to correspondence, you see"). He exaggerates his love for bureaucracy, joking that there’s an application form for everything, even for taking coffee breaks. He has a self-aware chuckle about his penchant for conflict-averse behavior, asking fellow countries to "take it outside" when debates get heated, much like an old-school schoolmaster.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Germany: The pragmatic and efficient older sibling, with whom he shares a love-hate relationship steeped in history and economics.
- Hungary: The fun, easygoing cousin who shares roots and fondness for Central European culinary delights.
- Italy: The artistic neighbor who often persuades Austria to loosen up and indulge more la dolce vita, albeit with some eye-rolls.
