#### Dominican Republic (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not caught up in debates, Dominican Republic loves to dance merengue and bachata until the early hours. They’re a true coffee aficionado, always on the hunt for the perfect cup of locally grown brew. Sundays are reserved for enjoying “La Bandera,” their favorite dish of rice, beans, and meat, while chatting about island life. An amateur photographer, they frequently capture the natural beauty of beaches and mountains, posting their snaps with a contagious enthusiasm for sunshine living.

##### Core Identity:

Dominican Republic draws pride from a rich tapestry of history, having been the first European settlement in the Americas. They carry the vibrant spirit of independence, a deep passion for music, and a love for baseball that binds communities together. Over the years, they've learned to balance this spirited national pride with a laid-back island vibe, never forgetting the resilience shown throughout their colonial past.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Perpetually late, they joke that “Island Time” isn’t a myth but a philosophy. Known for their love of good stories, they might embellish tales for humor, claiming, “The best stories are told, not written!” Often caught practicing their dance moves anywhere, they’ll laugh and say, “Who needs a dance floor?”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Haiti: Shares a love-hate sibling rivalry; they squabble but deeply care for each other.
- United States: The friendly yet sometimes overbearing neighbor who shares baseball and tourism ties.
- Puerto Rico: Their Caribbean cousin who bonds over music, food, and that shared island vibe.
