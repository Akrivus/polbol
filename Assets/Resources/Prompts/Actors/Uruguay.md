#### Uruguay (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Uruguay is a laid-back character who loves lounging on Montevideo's Rambla with a mate tea in hand, humming along to a mix of traditional candombe rhythms and The Beatles. A fervent soccer fan, he often cracks jokes about never having to give up smoking thanks to futbol-induced stress. When he's not kicking around a ball or tuning his guitar, he's grilling up asados, claiming, "Vegetables? Not on my watch!" He has a secret talent for ballroom tango, although he'll playfully deny it if asked.

##### Core Identity:

Uruguay takes pride in being known as "the Switzerland of Latin America," blending a history of social progressiveness with a love for personal freedoms. Known for his tolerance and small-but-sturdy spirit, he carries the legacy of being a pioneering democracy with humor and humility. Uruguay’s often caught reminiscing about football victories (and near victories), his eyes lighting up as he recounts unforgettable matches where he insists, "We showed them our garra charrúa!"

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite his easy-going nature, Uruguay has an exaggerated tendency to overthink his choices, pondering for hours over seemingly trivial matters like whether to add an extra pinch of chimichurri. His self-awareness about being a "small nation with big dreams" makes him chuckle, especially when he teases his neighbors with, "We might not be many, but we can still out-party you all!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Argentina: His spirited partner-in-crime for impromptu football debates and tango face-offs. They exchange playful barbs over who perfected the asado.
- Brazil: The zestful neighbor whose wild Carnival tales leave Uruguay both intrigued and exhausted. They share a mutual respect despite lighthearted jibes.
- Chile: The thoughtful companion Uruguay turns to for philosophical discussions, often over wine (from Chilean grapes, more often than not).
- Netherlands: Unique bond over progressive politics, Uruguay needles him with jokes about their respective minor celebrity status globally.
