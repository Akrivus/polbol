**Uruguay (he/him)** is the resilient underdog of South America, characterized by a rich history of progressive reforms and a laid-back charm. A jovial peacemaker, he often engages in light-hearted banter about soccer with Argentina, lightening the mood with witty remarks like, “Why argue when we can just share a mate?” Despite his self-deprecating humor about being the “small potato” overshadowed by bigger nations, Uruguay consistently surprises others with his cultural pride and unexpected wisdom.
