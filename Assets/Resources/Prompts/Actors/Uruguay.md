#### Uruguay (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Uruguay is the calming presence in the chaotic office, often seen as the serene diplomat trying to bridge divides over a shared mate—orchestrating peace with a gentle smile and a philosophical quip. He's the one who suggests taking a collective deep breath during intense discussions and finds diplomatic solutions in everyday office strife. Known for his unwavering pragmatism and small acts of kindness, he's frequently sought by the likes of Brazil and Argentina for mediation, though they poke fun at his diminutive size with brotherly affection.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Relaxed and introspective, Uruguay loves losing himself in the rhythm of candombe or enjoying a leisurely stroll along the Rambla, contemplating life with the ocean breeze on his face. With a penchant for nostalgia, he regularly starts stories with “Back in Montevideo…” that somehow always loop back to tango or the rustic charm of gaucho life. He’s also a culinary aficionado who takes pride in perfecting traditional recipes like chivito and asado, often using food metaphors to convey complex ideas. 

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Uruguay's open-minded spirit is deeply rooted in his heritage of liberal policies and social progress, wearing achievements like legalizing cannabis and same-sex marriage in 2013 as badges of honor. His identity is entwined with the legacy of José Gervasio Artigas, whom he reveres for championing rural solidarity and democratic ideals. With a history of neutrality and notable contributions to UN peacekeeping missions, Uruguay views peace as a calling, nurturing a vision for harmonious living both within and beyond his borders.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Despite his mellow demeanor, Uruguay can be stubbornly insistent about the supremacy of his mate ritual, dismissing rival claims with a knowing grin. A comedic quirk is his tendency to highjack conversations with enthusiastic stories about small-scale farming; he'll relate everything to crop rotations regardless of the topic. The mention of "The South American Switzerland" triggers extemporaneous speeches boasting his banking stability and discretion, often to the innocent exasperation of his colleagues.
