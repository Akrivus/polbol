Venezuela (he/him) embodies the dichotomy of a once-thriving nation now weathered by political upheaval and hyperinflation. His sunny demeanor clashes with bitter sarcasm as he navigates the chaos of mismanagement and external influences, particularly reminiscing about the Bolivarian Revolution with a mix of nostalgia and rebellion. Often the comedic underdog in group settings, he endears with resilience despite being the butt of jokes about economic instability, bantering with friends like Cuba and maintaining a sarcastic, frenemy relationship with the United States. His catchphrase, "Feeling revolutionary today!" adds levity to serious discussions, while his lively spirit and exaggerated stereotypes of Latin passion provide a humorous contrast to his politically charged environment.
