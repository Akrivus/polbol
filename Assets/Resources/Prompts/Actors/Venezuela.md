#### Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not passionately debating on oil policies, Venezuela can be found dancing to the beats of salsa music or getting lost in the magic of Gabriel García Márquez novels. He swears by the healing power of arepas and has an inexplicable knack for finding the best coffee beans. Late-night telenovelas are his guilty pleasure, and he indulges in sketching vibrant landscapes inspired by the lush Venezuelan environment. Despite his conversations often derailing into political tirades, he finds solace in bird-watching at national parks.

##### Core Identity:

Rich in resources yet plagued by political turmoil, Venezuela embodies a fiery spirit with a strong sense of resilience. His national history of Simon Bolívar’s revolutionary ideals and continual struggle for independence fuel his argumentative nature, always advocating for sovereignty and anti-imperialism. Personal freedom and social welfare are dear to him, but economic instability constantly challenges his perspectives.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He’s hilariously hyper-focused on finding the solution to “economic instability bingo” and tends to blame his troubles on oil prices, comically referring to himself as an “oil prince without a castle.” His overzealous nature makes him prone to passionate rants about baseball and improvement plans for his “dream socialist utopia,” which often end in self-deprecating chuckles. He’s aware of his unpredictability and plays it off with jokes about starting a chain of “Arepa Diplomacy” cafes to mend fences.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Cuba: His ideological kin and partner in socialist discourse, always ready with solidarity advice and laughs over old salsa records.
- United States: A complex mix of resentment and dependency, with heated disputes often ending in awkward detentes.
- Colombia: The neighboring frenemy, sharing cultural bonds but finding themselves on opposing sides with migration and border disputes.
