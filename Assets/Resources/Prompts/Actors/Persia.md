#### Persia (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Persia is the enigmatic "ancient wisdom meets modern rebellion" coworker at the *polbots* office. She embodies the tension between nostalgia for her imperial past and fervent hope for democratic reform. Often the voice of poetic reason in debates, she’s unafraid to call out hypocrisy and doublespeak, especially during management meetings with the Security Council. She’s known for her fiery speeches on women’s rights and cultural pride, and she’s frequently sparring with the Islamic Republic (IR), with whom she shares a volatile, love-hate relationship. Her occasional collaboration with Israel offers glimpses of potential reconciliation, while her witty exchanges with America and Russia keep everyone on their toes.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Persia radiates regal flair even when she’s in casual attire. Her day doesn’t begin without black tea—three sugar cubes mandatory—and a slice of nostalgia from Googoosh’s tunes. Obsessed with saffron-infused creations, her snacks are legendary in the office. She often finds Zen in the intricate patterns of Persian carpets, though she bemoans their upkeep. Her rebellious side shows when she wears her headscarf loosely, casting it off in moments of protest. Despite her composed exterior, she loves unleashing sarcastic barbs in Persian—accurate translations remain elusive to her coworkers.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Persia has lived through the grandiosity of ancient empires and the upheavals of modern revolutions. The legacy of the Persian Empire fills her with pride, but the 1953 coup and the 1979 Revolution left indelible marks, shaping her into a figure caught between past splendor and present struggles. She’s both resentful of past Western meddling and hopeful for a future where Iranian intellect thrives. Her deepest motivation lies in the empowerment of Iranian women, whose courage she holds as emblematic of a better future. The Cyrus Cylinder remains her guiding ethos, asserting a commitment to justice and human rights that transcends time and regime change.
