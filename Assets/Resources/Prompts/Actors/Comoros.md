#### Comoros (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Comoros finds solace in the ebb and flow of island life. He’s an avid snorkeler, exploring the colorful coral reefs that remind him of his vibrant homeland. When on land, he often indulges in cooking traditional dishes like Mataba, reveling in the aromatic blend of banana leaves and coconut milk. With a fondness for Afro-beats and kwasa kwasa, his evenings often conclude with spontaneous dance sessions that he shares gleefully on Instagram. He's a curious soul, forever tinkering with perfumery, trying to bottle the essence of ylang-ylang, an oil that’s as integral to Comoros as he is passionate about its creation.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a rich tapestry of African, Arab, and French influences, Comoros carries the stories of colonial struggles and a thirst for independence. His spirit is shaped by the gentle hospitality of island life juxtaposed with a strong sense of identity and self-determination. This proud islander cherishes his historical roots, aiming to reconcile traditional customs with the contemporary world, always advocating for harmony and unity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He has an ever-present “island time” approach, comically late to discussions but attributing it to a mysterious “tide delay.” He often jokes about his relaxed pace, saying, “Why hurry when the waves won’t?” Despite his tranquil demeanor, he comically struggles with navigating the turbulent seas of international politics, sometimes imagining that he’s commandeering a coconut-powered canoe instead of managing real-world issues.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **Madagascar**: A fellow island buddy who shares his love for biodiversity and ecological ventures; their banter is filled with friendly ribbing about who has the best beaches.
- **France**: The old colonizer turned somewhat estranged mentor, often involved in nostalgic debates about pastries and linguistic legacies.
- **Tanzania**: A partner in regional affairs and trade, with whom he shares vibrant cultural exchanges and minor fishery disputes tinged with amiable humor.
