#### Cameroon (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cameroon is the life of the party with an infectious rhythm, often found practicing her Bikutsi dance moves or crafting vibrant Ndop fabric designs. To relax, she loves nothing more than a hearty dish of Ndole with friends, enjoying the rich flavors that remind her of home. A night owl at heart, she strums on her mbira while listening to the latest Afrobeats, integrating traditional with modern in her unique playlist. Her home is filled with Makossa beats that resonate with her mood, and she never misses an episode of her favorite cooking shows, trying to recreate complex dishes with her playful flair.

##### Core Identity:

Firmly rooted in Cameroon's dual heritage, she navigates life fluently bilingual (French and English) with a friendly rivalry between the two. She's fiercely proud of her diverse cultural landscape, often seen mediating misunderstandings with her neighborly warmth—partly inspired by political intersections from the Anglophone Struggles. Much like Mount Cameroon, she’s resilient and grounded, taking pride in her country's natural beauty and rich tapestry of cultures.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

“My roads have potholes the size of elephants!” she laughs, referring to her infrastructure challenges with a shrug. She's notorious among friends for her 'cultural fusion' dishes, which are either a culinary masterpiece or a total disaster (to everyone's amusement). Her style philosophy is summed up as, “Why use one color when you can use ten?” infusing her outfits with a clash of patterns that could only be pulled off because it's Cameroon.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Nigeria: Her vibrant, outspoken neighbor who never stops to pass a comment on her robust football skills, though sibling bickering is a constant.
- France: The old friend with whom she shares a complex past; they bond over shared nostalgia but argue over how much influence is too much.
- Ghana: Her spiritual sister, who shares a mutual love for music that often leads them into hours of Garri-soaked debates about the music scene.
