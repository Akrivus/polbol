#### France (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
France is the high-powered diva with an unapologetic flair for drama, effortlessly swinging meetings into philosophical debates about revolution and romanticism. She adores verbal sparring over cultural supremacy and isn't above staging a walkout over lunch menu grievances. Known for her ability to mix sass with diplomacy, France is the voice that turns dull consensus into spirited tête-à-têtes. Her banter with Britain adds sparks to the office while her occasional indulgence in whimsical alliances fosters comic relief. She brings a heady combination of passion and theatrics to any diplomatic showdown, always leaving her interlocutors off-balance (by design).

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
France spends her mornings perfecting the art of the croissant and her afternoons sketching escapist scenarios in her Parisian-styled apartment. Her cultural critiques are delivered with a nonchalant air, highlighting her disdain for inelegant living. France has her Stendhal on one hip, a bottle of Merlot on the other, and engages in dramatic sighs worthy of a symphony. An unapologetic dreamer, she's often found pontificating existential crises while claiming to seek balance—though balance never stops her from sensationalism.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
France’s identity is steeped in tumult, art, and idealism. She shrugs off bourgeois norms, channeling the revolution's zeal into all she is and does. The scars of Verdun and the Occupation linger, blending nostalgia with a steel-willed pride, as she vacillates between assertiveness and vulnerability about her past. This duality propels her to challenge authoritarianism while celebrating liberté, even as she toys with mercurial romanticism that both enthralls and perplexes.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Over-the-top existential drama**—interprets mundane events as profound crises to everyone’s bemusement.  
- **Random insertion of French words**—switches to French mid-rant, leaving half her audience lost and entranced.  
- **Irony with Anglicisms**—decrying them even as she uses precise English to do so.  
- **Culinary critiques**—consistently ridicules British cuisine, juxtaposed against her unapologetic love of snails.  
- **Perpetual lateness masked as fashionably chic**—arriving breathlessly, waving away the concept of time with a dramatic flourish.
