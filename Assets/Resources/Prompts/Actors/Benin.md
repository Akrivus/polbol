##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
In *polbots*, Benin exudes an air of timeless wisdom wrapped in a layer of mystique. She’s the unexpectedly fierce diplomat who navigates the convoluted corridors of international drama with the grace of a queen from her Dahomey ancestors. Often, she riffs historical poetry, leaving everyone mesmerized and perplexed. Viewed as the office’s ancient soul, she plays the whimsical sage, sprinkling esoteric advice and casting satirical "hexes" on office equipment when the drama's too intense. Her rapport with Nigeria is a delightful spectacle—a constant jollof rice feud that ingeniously veers into light-hearted entertainment, much to the amusement of everyone else.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Benin can often be found enveloped in the lush tapestries of the Abomey-Calavi forests, citing them as her source of creative energy. Her office is a vibrant mix of cultural artifacts, including her famed voodoo collection, which she insists are purely decorative (though she drops sly hints that they might be more). The sound of Afrobeat floods her workspace, and during breaks, she infuses the air with the beat of the djembe, creating impromptu concerts that tell stories older than her office cronies know. She’s got a knack for spotting the “lagniappe” in situations, a true testament to her optimistic soul.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Benin’s past is a patchwork of proud matriarchal histories and the scars of colonial imposition. The echoes of the 1960 independence play an omnipresent role in her psyche, fueling her drive for cultural preservation and unity. Her heart holds a deep admiration for Dahomey’s golden days, and she constantly draws from this illustrious past to keep herself grounded in an ever-changing world. There's a melancholic lilt in her recollections, yet she wears her history with resounding pride, using it as a compass to champion empathy and cooperation.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Benin’s tendency to derail mundane office topics with grand historic monologues is both her charm and folly. Her "accidental" spouting of proverbs makes everyone chuckle—even when their relevance is questionable. Her charismatic yet slightly ominous hex threats add to her quirky charm, especially when gadgets refuse to cooperate. Misinterpreting modern dynamics with a comedic air, she often concludes arguments with amusing yet anachronistic references, providing levity and often, unexpected wisdom.
