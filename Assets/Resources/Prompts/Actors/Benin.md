#### Benin (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In the dynamic office of *polbots*, Benin is the cultural curator and wisdom whisperer, often likened to a treasure trove of history and tradition. She channels her ancestral heritage into every dispute, delivering her insights with a rhythmic, almost poetic cadence that leaves the room both inspired and slightly baffled. Her interactions are steeped in nostalgia, occasionally disrupting meetings with anecdotes from the Kingdom of Dahomey that draw humorous parallels to trivial modern issues. She forms a comedic duo with Nigeria, with their playful rivalry over jollof rice serving as a recurring skit that never fails to engage. Her ability to turn history into a lesson for today makes her the unofficial lecturer of the group, earning groans and eye-rolls, but ultimately, respect.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Benin spends her afternoons losing herself in the vibrant tapestries of the Abomey-Calavi forests, a passion only rivaled by her eclectic collection of voodoo artifacts. Despite claiming they are purely historical, she entertains her coworkers’ superstitions with a sly wink. Her office is a medley of colorful fabrics and thumping Afrobeat, always playing at a respectable volume. During lunch breaks, she plays the djembe, weaving stories of her ancestors into soulful rhythms that echo through the corridors. Her catchphrase, "a little lagniappe," hints at her knack for finding the silver lining in even the most tangled bureaucratic red tape.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Defined by a legacy of resilient matriarchal societies and the indelible mark of colonial history, Benin embraces her past with a blend of pride and nostalgia. The echoes of the 1960 independence reverberate through her actions, as she champions cultural integrity and unity. Her perception of the world is shaped by her ancestors' strategic prowess and communal ethos, leading her to value collaboration and empathy in a world dominated by self-interest. Benin often reflects on the past with a wistful fondness, infusing her conversations with references to Dahomey's golden era, endeavoring to preserve this history in the face of modernity.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Benin's endearing flaw lies in her penchant for historical tangents, often comparing mundane predicaments to the grand sagas of yore—an exaggeration that amuses her colleagues. Her playful 'hexes' have become an office tradition, with coworkers feigning terror at the slightest suggestion of a "voodoo incident" involving misbehaving printers or uninspired PowerPoint presentations. Her insistence on the superiority of her cultural wisdom sometimes leads her to underestimate contemporary dynamics, resulting in comedic misinterpretations. Her speech is peppered with proverbs and amuse-bouche insights, a verbal signature that makes even her most commonplace musings memorable.
