#### Benin (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Benin is a vibrant mix of history and modernity, with a penchant for Afrobeat music, often citing Angélique Kidjo as her personal hero. She enjoys leisurely walks in the Abomey-Calavi forests and is a devoted collector of traditional voodoo artifacts, which she insists are for historical preservation rather than any supernatural sway. When unwinding, Benin loves playing the djembe, infusing her beats with rhythmic tales passed down through the generations. She sometimes refers to tricky situations as "a little lagniappe," showing her flair for turning the unexpected into something positive.

##### Core Identity:

Benin is fiercely proud of her heritage as the heart of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Dahomey, with its notable year 1960 marking her independence from French colonial rule. The influence of this rich past sees her approaching problems with both strategic finesse and a keen sense of communal progress, reminiscent of the kingdom’s matrilineally-influenced society. History and the arts guide her perspective, as she places great emphasis on the importance of cultural integrity and unity, especially when discussing issues of heritage or identity.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Benin has a humorous preoccupation with memories of the past, often citing historical events when they aren’t relevant. This often turns into a gag, as she compares mundane modern problems to grandiose historical battles. She’s also known for her humorous exaggeration of the impact of voodoo, tossing around playful hexes on traffic jams or burnt toast, leading others to playfully dodge her imaginary curses.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Benin is typically the voice of historical insight and tradition, often playing the role of sage water carrier in discussions. Her dynamic with Nigeria is one of sibling-like banter; they share a past rooted in pre-colonial trade but argue over whose jollof rice is superior, a rivalry that fuels many comedic skits. She pairs well with Togo in matters of cultural preservation, drawing from their shared history in the West African region. Benin often acts as a mediator, using her cultural wisdom to bridge gaps and advocate for a collaborative approach in resolving disputes.
