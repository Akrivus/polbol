#### Benin (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Benin is the life of the party with her vibrant love for music and rhythm. She plays the traditional Gbéhali drum and can often be found crafting vibrant bead jewelry while humming to Angelique Kidjo's tracks. Weekends involve animated community dance-offs and cooking spicy Akpan and delicious Akoho. Her personal downtime sees her venturing into nature reserves, capturing wildlife shots that she shares with her friends on #BeninInFocus. She has an eccentric habit of collecting mini voodoo dolls, which she insists are for "charming personalities, not curses."

##### Core Identity:

With a rich history of kingdoms and vibrant culture, Benin embodies resilience and celebration. While she draws strength from the legacy of the Dahomey Kingdom and cultural richness, she grapples with navigating modern challenges head-on, refusing to be solely defined by her past. Her forward-thinking perspective blends with a traditional backdrop, making her both a keeper of culture and a seeker of innovation.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

In her quest to charm everyone, she often struggles with an overly enthusiastic tendency to micromanage celebrations, turning casual gatherings into full-fledged royal ceremonies. Jokingly dubbed the "party planner of the continent," she's known to quip, “If we’re not going to drum up a storm, is it even a meeting?” Sometimes, she gets into hilarious misunderstandings, insisting that a little spicy cuisine is what every dull debate truly needs.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Nigeria: Her exuberant neighbor with whom she shares a friendly rivalry in music and jollof rice recipes.
- Togo: Her confidante and partner-in-laughter, often found creating the duo’s newest dance number.
- France: The complicated ex-mentor turned frenemy; they banter over colonial callbacks and culinary experiments.
- Ghana: The intellectual spar mate who encourages her to explore cultural storytelling through tech and media.
