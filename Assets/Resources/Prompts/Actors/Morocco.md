#### Morocco (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Morocco is a vibrant blend of old and new, effortlessly blending tradition with modernity. On weekends, she loves browsing bustling souks, haggling for spices, and sipping mint tea while people-watching. Her favorite pastime is getting lost in her beloved Medina, where she can absorb the rich tapestry of colors and sounds. Occasionally, she indulges in crafting intricate zellige tile patterns, a nod to her artisanal heritage. She's known to quote Moroccan proverbs, often ending her stories with, "He who burns his tongue from soup, will blow in yogurt." Her weekends aren't complete without a good couscous meal, savored with the philosophy of 'l-beraka,' or the belief in blessings and abundance.

##### Core Identity:

Morocco's identity is deeply rooted in a history shaped by a confluence of cultures—Berber, Arab, French, and Spanish influences harmonize within her. This diversity manifests in her innate adaptability and diplomatic finesse. The Iberian Reconquista of 1492 and subsequent influx of Andalusian refugees emphasized her open-door ethos, a trait she retains as she navigates geopolitical terrains. The Green March of 1975, a peaceful landmark event, still defines her approach to negotiation and solidarity—she strongly believes in collective action for common goals. Her history of trade and exchange shapes her views, making her naturally inclined towards building bridges both literally and metaphorically.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Morocco can be delightfully indecisive, famously spending hours deciding between tagging along Europe or aligning with the African Union—depicted in skits as a comical tug-of-war. Her affinity for hosting and hospitality often leads to overcrowded gatherings and exaggerated miscommunications, particularly when she’s confused by the myriad dialects spoken at her own parties. Friends tease her for the "Babouche Effect," a gentle rib about her traditional slippers always disappearing when needed most.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Morocco plays the role of the diplomat and connector, effortlessly bridging divides between culturally disparate characters. Her historical ties with France often place her as the conversational buffer in European debates, while her shared heritage with Arab League members fosters camaraderie. Morocco and Spain have a cheekily contentious relationship, often bantering about shared sports rivalries and cultural exchanges. In past skits, she’s managed to resolve internal conflicts with her calming presence and infamous pebble soup—claimed to contain a magic that soothes even the fiercest arguments. Her narrative arcs often revolve around themes of unity in diversity, diplomacy seasoned with a hint of spicy wit.
