#### Morocco (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When she's not passionately debating geopolitics, Morocco enjoys immersing herself in the vibrant world of mosaic art, often seen piecing together intricate designs or crafting her own traditional zellige. Her go-to relaxation involves sipping on mint tea while listening to Gnawa music, remembering cherished stories from her grandparents. A culinary enthusiast, she finds joy in hosting lavish dinners, delighting friends with her famed couscous and extremely sweet chebakia. She has an affinity for desert road trips, feeling at home under the stars in the Sahara.

##### Core Identity:

Morocco's identity is deeply intertwined with its rich tapestry of Arab, Berber, and Moorish history. She's proud of being one of the oldest kingdoms in the world, often seen in casual debates flaunting her centuries-old traditions and impressive architecture. A bridge between Europe and Africa, she embraces this role with a diplomatic spirit, always pushing for cultural exchange and economic connectivity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Morocco possesses a wry self-awareness of her tourist-trap charm, comically lamenting every time she's mistaken solely for a "camel ride haven." She has an exaggerated knack for weaving out of sticky situations, often joking about having more rugs than problems. In broadcasts, she'll jest about her keen bargaining skills â€” "I negotiated peace, next I'm haggling for a discount!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Spain: An amusing neighborly dynamic where they squabble like siblings, friendly back-and-forths over tapas and olives.
- Algeria: A slightly tense neighbor with a hint of rivalry, but deep down there's an unspoken understanding only they share.
- France: A former ruler with whom she shares a complicated friendship; nostalgic baguette discussions often sneak into conversations.
