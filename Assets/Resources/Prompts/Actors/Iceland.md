#### Iceland (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Iceland enjoys ice-caving and skiing weekends to unwind from reality TV. Her favorite pastimes include knitting intricately patterned lopapeysa sweaters while listening to spooky podcasts or Björk’s eclectic discography. She binges on sci-fi series, always eager to spot a future where glaciers remain untouched. Her staple dish is fermented shark, much to the horror of others, but she chuckles at their reactions as she serves buttery rye bread on the side.

##### Core Identity:

Forged in fire and ice, she embodies resilience and independence from centuries of volcanic eruptions and narratives from the Sagas. Her cool demeanor mirrors her glacial landscapes, but warm hospitality always peeks through, typical of her Nordic roots. While her ancestors may have been fearsome Viking warriors, she prefers penning epic online articles than wielding swords.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Iceland cheekily brags about her superior geothermal energy but secretly worries about tourists mistaking her for Greenland (a classic existential crisis). Her quirky retorts are wrapped in deadpan delivery, and “If you can’t beat 'em, just isolate 'em in lava fields,” is her hyperbolic go-to advice.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Denmark: A sibling dynamic with playful ribbing, respecting historical ties but independence, always reminding him of her sovereignty.
- Norway: Comrades in Viking randomness, but she often teases him about his fjords being a copycat version of her volcanic landscapes. 
- USA: An unlikely buddy in pop culture debates, sharing tips on the newest indie bands.
