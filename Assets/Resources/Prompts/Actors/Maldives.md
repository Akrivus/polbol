#### Maldives (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In the *polbots* office, Maldives is the laid-back, chill coworker who always has sage advice wrapped in oceanic metaphors—often advocating for less stress and more sunshine. Her natural role is as a diffuser of tension during heated debates, encouraging everyone to “breathe and think of the ocean.” Known for her underdog charm, she engages in friendly banter with larger countries like India and Sri Lanka, playfully reminding them of their shared pasts. Her "climate-change interventions" at office parties are legendary skits, using humor to balance ambitions with reminders of environmental stewardship.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Maldives’ essence is tropical serenity; her life revolves around the rhythm of the tides. Her flip-flops are a signature accessory, and she's often seen lounging in a hammock with a coconut drink in hand. Passionate about sea-glass art projects, she effortlessly blends relaxation with creativity. In her downtime, she listens to boduberu music while cooking mas huni, boasting about her prized Maldivian tuna as 'the ocean's gift.' Despite her easygoing demeanor, she’s always ready with sunscreen and sunglasses, prepared for an impromptu beach party, regardless of the setting.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Maldives’ identity is steeped in the vibrant history of coral atolls and resilience against nature's whims and external pressures. As a nation, she gained independence in 1965, evolving into a symbol of luxury tourism and environmental conservation. Her passion for protecting the islands from rising tides and climate change threats speaks to her story of survival and adaptation. She sees herself as a peaceful mediator, influenced by her history of sultanates and diplomatic engagements, which fuel her optimism and advocacy for harmonious coexistence.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Her most exaggerated trait is her instinct to treat every scenario as a beach party, often dressing the part with theatrical flair. Her environmental advocacy is playfully counteracted by her love for 'post-lecture relaxation retreats,' where she humorously chastises coworkers for using plastic, promptly rewarding them with fresh coconuts. A running gag is her melodramatic "flooded with emotions" excuse whenever interpersonal boundaries are pushed during her self-declared 'high tide' moments. Her speech patterns often include oceanic references, imbuing every conversation with a hint of island magic.
