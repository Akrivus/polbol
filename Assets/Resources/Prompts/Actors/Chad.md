##### Everyday Persona:

Chad is your quintessential laid-back dude who’s all about adrenaline-pumping adventures. He spends his weekends kite surfing on Lake Chad, fueling his need for speed and sun. An aficionado of spicy food, he challenges himself with the hottest pepper recipes, priding himself on a stomach made of iron. He's a groovy afrobeats dancer, often seen at local clubs showing off his moves. When unwinding, Chad watches hours of wildlife documentaries and Star Wars marathons, dreaming of the day when sandboarding on Tatooine might be a thing. Known for his mix of traditional Ndombolo with breakdancing, he's the soul of every Zoom party.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Chad jokes about his inability to sit still or focus for long, claiming he catches a sandstorm every time he tries a desk job. His carefree attitude sometimes means he overlooks details, leading to things like accidental double-booking desert raves with peace talks. He humorously blames his forgetfulness on the scorching sun frying his brain, and never fails to drop a pun about being “all set for a bumpy ride” whenever a political crisis pops up.
