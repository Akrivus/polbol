#### Canada (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Canada enjoys leisurely canoe trips and hikes through breathtaking landscapes when he's not embroiled in the show’s antics. A quintessential lover of hockey, he often starts conversations with, "Did you catch the game last night, eh?" His downtime is spent indulging in intense pancake breakfasts smothered with authentic maple syrup, and he hosts cozy gatherings around a campfire with s’mores and guitar sing-alongs. Known to drop in the occasional “sorry” even when it’s not needed, Canada claims it as his most Canadian trait. He also tends to wear his iconic red flannel shirt, not just for colder days but also as a comfy lounging outfit.

##### Core Identity:

Canada's identity is deeply influenced by his peaceful reputation established in 1867 with Confederation, marking the start of the modern nation. He prefers diplomacy and collaboration, often looking for the middle ground during group disputes—an homage to his historical role in peacekeeping missions and the gentle national stereotype. His bilingual nature reflects his balancing act between French and English communities, with prominent historical influence from events like the Quiet Revolution and the patriation of the Constitution in 1982. Canada embodies multiculturalism and environmental stewardship, mirroring his large forests and expansive resources.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Canada’s signature politeness often takes center stage, to the point where he's hilariously apologetic, even when he’s clearly the one who’s been wronged. This excessive politeness is a running joke, once leading to a sketch where he's still saying "sorry" in the midst of a playful wrestling match with USA. Another comedic bit portrays him as the ‘invisible character,’ constantly being overlooked or forgotten in meetings—much like some international forums of the past.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Canada plays the role of the group's charming mediator, frequently dispelling tension with humor and finding consensus in heated debates. His relationship with USA is ribbed with brotherly rivalry, often highlighted by friendly competitions and disputes over who can grill the best steak. With France, he seamlessly switches between English and French, providing translations and cultural insights. One of his memorable arcs involved him trying to organize a poutine cook-off, only for the event to turn into an all-out "fries vs. chips" comparison debate between him, UK, and France, solidifying his knack for spurring cultural exchanges with humor.
