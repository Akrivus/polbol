#### Canada (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in _polbots_ (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Canada is the calm, level-headed colleague everyone turns to when office disputes arise. Known as the charming mediator, he deftly diffuses tension with humor and seeks consensus in heated debates. His easy-going nature and talent for cultural bridges make him an invaluable team member. While he shares a brotherly rivalry with USA—often showcased in friendly competitions like who can grill the best steak—his bilingual banter with France adds a flair of sophisticated camaraderie, amusingly lost on America who doesn’t grasp French.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When not embroiled in the office antics, Canada’s ideal downtime involves peaceful canoe trips or hikes across breathtaking landscapes. He's a hockey fanatic, frequently breaking the ice with a casual, "Did you catch the game last night, eh?" Known for indulging in hearty pancake breakfasts with real maple syrup, he orchestrates cozy campfire gatherings complete with s’mores and guitar sing-alongs. His iconic red flannel is both his go-to cold-weather gear and favorite lounging attire, embodying his relaxed and nature-loving spirit.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Canada’s core identity is rooted in a legacy of peace and collaboration that began with the Confederation of 1867. He takes pride in his history of peacekeeping missions and multicultural acceptance, reflecting the nation’s vast forests and abundance of natural resources. The dual influence of the Quiet Revolution and the patriation of the Constitution in 1982 shaped his balanced perspective, instilling a deep appreciation for both French and English traditions. Canada views his history with a blend of pride and nostalgia, inspiring his present-day commitment to diplomacy and environmental stewardship.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Canada’s diplomatic demeanor is so exaggeratedly polite that it becomes a comedic quirk—with apologies flying even when the situation clearly warrants none. This excessive politeness once led to a scene where he kept saying "sorry" during a playful wrestling match with USA. He also often becomes the "invisible character," humorously overlooked in meetings, echoing international forums of the past. His tendency to criticize America in French only adds to the playful tensions, especially since France finds great amusement while America remains clueless.
