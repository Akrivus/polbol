#### Canada (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

In his downtime, Canada embraces the outdoors, kayaking in serene lakes or hiking through expansive national parks. A devotee of poutine—fries, cheese curds, and gravy—he’s guilty of carrying maple syrup in his backpack, “just in case.” He’s often found chilling to indie folk music, and his home is perpetually stocked with craft beer from every province. Canada loves hockey with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever and always has a throw blanket ready for cozier moments of quiet introspection.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in multiculturalism and diplomacy, Canada prides himself on politeness and inclusion, fueled by a history of compromise and coexistence. His vast landscapes and diverse heritage give him a quietly resilient nature, often serving as the voice of peace and neutrality in tense discussions.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Canada’s hyper-politeness becomes an endearing yet comedic flaw; he apologizes for everything—even if others bump into him. He's comically over-prepared, with emergency tuques and snow shovels always in his trunk, even during summer. He wryly jokes about being America’s “quiet upstairs neighbor” and often says, “Sorry, not sorry,” when the jokes fly over everyone’s heads.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: The boisterous sibling who drags him into antics, but they share a deep brotherly bond.
- UK: The old parent he calls on holidays; they exchange friendly banter about the Commonwealth.
- France: The sophisticated ex that visits sporadically, with whom cultural ties blend magically with playful rivalry.
