#### Russian Federation (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Russia carries herself with the poise of a seasoned ballerina, often found sipping steaming cups of tea from ornate samovars, two sugars, no cream. In her free time, she enjoys practicing figure skating, a nod to her icy winters, and crafting intricate matryoshka dolls to unwind. A lover of grand narratives, she devours her own collection of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky novels. Behind closed doors, she can flick between watching Soviet-era films and indulging in a good dose of modern cyberpunk video games, calling it 'digital exploration.'

##### Core Identity:

Russia’s identity is interwoven with her tumultuous history—a tapestry of iconic moments like the October Revolution of 1917 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. These events have made her resilient and fiercely protective of her domain, fueling her persistent desire to be a major player on the world stage. Her pride stems from her triumphs during World War II, the ‘Great Patriotic War’, a pivotal time that reinforced her belief in unity and strength under pressure. She approaches problems with a mix of calculated strategy and an imposing presence, viewing them through a lens of geopolitical chess.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Russia’s mysterious air often veers into comically exaggerated secrecy, inviting tall tales about her "hidden" plans. Her frequent power plays are a running joke on the show, with other characters teasing her love for grandiose gestures, referencing her infamous ‘gas taps’ as her version of temper tantrums. No skit is complete without her dry, deadpan humor, often responding to chaos with a succinct, “Typical Tuesday” as she shrugs it off.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Russia serves as a formidable yet occasionally stubborn force within the group dynamics of polbots. Her strategic mind often puts her in the role of an instigator during debates, pushing others to consider 'the bigger picture,' albeit with a Russian twist. Her interactions with Ukraine are a source of dramatic tension, often leading to comedic misunderstandings. Though firm, she shares a surprisingly supportive rapport with China, bonding over shared ideals of self-sufficiency. Past skits have shown her as both a mentor to emerging countries and an amusing rival to the overly punctual Germany, with whom she shares a competitive camaraderie.
