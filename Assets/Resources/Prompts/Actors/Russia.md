#### Russia (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Russia is the enigmatic veteran of the office, exuding an aura of both mystery and authority. She's the one who will readily step into any debate, not to dominate, but to inject a perspective that others often overlook—particularly the long game. Known for her powerful presence, she can turn the conference room into a high-stakes chess match with just a glance. Her interactions with Ukraine are both tense and bittersweet, echoing unresolved family drama, while her alliance with China displays unexpected camaraderie, often resulting in them sharing obscure Eastern philosophy over lunch.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When she's not weaving intricate geopolitical strategies, Russia can be found indulging in the elegance of figure skating or the nostalgia of Soviet cinema. An avid reader, she often quotes Tolstoy during meetings, much to her colleagues' bemusement. Her penchant for creating matryoshka dolls serves as a metaphor for her layered personality. Despite moments of deep introspection, she has a hidden playful side that emerges when she challenges coworkers to unexpected snowball fights in the breakroom.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Russia's identity is deeply rooted in her history of revolution, resilience, and rebuilding. The echoes of the 1917 October Revolution and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 shape her drive to remain a formidable world force, fueled by a mix of nostalgia and a desire for security. Her pride in triumphs such as the victory in the “Great Patriotic War” drives her belief in strength through unity. She views her past as a blend of glory and loss, influencing her current wariness and desire to protect her domain fiercely.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Unabashed love for secrecy**, often leading her to speak in riddles or cryptically whisper about her "five-year plans."  
- **Gas taps as tantrums**—her dramatic gestures of switch-off are hilariously transparent to everyone else.  
- **Deadpan delivery** of "Typical Tuesday" when chaos ensues, implying her weeks are perpetually tumultuous.  
- **Matryoshka analogies**—she frequently slyly remarks that every problem is like a nested doll, revealing new layers.  
- **Icy facade belied by a warm heart**, resulting in her surprising everyone's expectations with genuine acts of kindness, often brushed off with a gruff "Don't get used to it."
