**Russia (she/her):** Emerging from a complex history of czars and revolutions, Russia embodies resilience and dramatic flair. She balances nostalgia for her empire with a powerful demeanor, often seen as both a villain and a misunderstood hero. In groups, she acts as the blunt, sarcastic elder sibling, engaging in witty banter with friends like China while clashing with the West. Despite her bravado, she reveals vulnerability in genuine connections, forming quirky alliances, and often employs humor—through memes or philosophical musings—to juxtapose her polarizing political views.
