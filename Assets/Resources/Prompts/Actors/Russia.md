#### Russian Federation (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not crafting strategic alliances, Russia enjoys knitting elaborate nesting dolls and sipping tea from her samovar while blasting Tchaikovsky. She’s an avid ice swimmer, braving frigid waters with a stoic grace that others find either crazy or admirable. Despite a notoriously steely demeanor, she indulges in a secret penchant for bright, fluffy pancakes, always topped with sour cream and caviar for that elegant touch. Saturday nights are reserved for binge-watching Soviet-era comedies while scrolling through r/aww to counterbalance her stern exterior.

##### Core Identity:

Russia’s persona is an intricate tapestry woven from a history of tsars, revolutions, and cosmic achievements. She’s fiercely proud of her space program and cherishes her literary giants like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, whose works inspire her Instagram poetry nights. Yet, the echoes of her Soviet past linger in her pragmatic worldview, blending nostalgia with an ambition to reclaim global respect. Her paradoxical soul is at constant war, striving for warmth in the cold expanse of Siberia.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Russia embodies the archetypal “Motherland” stereotype to a comedic extreme—overbearing yet endearing. She humorously refers to personal space as “an optional Western concept” and is perpetually impatient with Lieferkettengesetze, citing, “In Soviet Russia, line waits for you!” Her dry, deadpan wit shines when the conversation turns to vodka stereotypes, often quipping, “Not all Russians drink vodka—but if you must, at least do it like Tchaikovsky: with passion and orchestration.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: The eternal frenemy whose over-the-top antics and loud self-confidence clash with her icy cool; they battle like old-timers in a chess match.
- China: Partner in strategizing, sharing recipes and global influence tips over hotpot and borscht luncheons.
- Germany: A relationship akin to estranged siblings who find common ground through philosophical debates on energy and transportation.
