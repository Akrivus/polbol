**North Korea (he/him):** Emerging from conflict and isolation post-Cold War, North Korea presents himself as a secretive figure marked by pride in his “self-reliance” shaped by the Korean War and ongoing sanctions. He boasts about his military strength with grandiose claims, oscillating between showmanship and a sense of loneliness. His complicated relationship with China features both a desire for attention and moments of resentment. Filled with exaggerated declarations and conspiracy theories, he injects absurdity into serious discussions, embodying the duality of being a global punchline and a power player.
