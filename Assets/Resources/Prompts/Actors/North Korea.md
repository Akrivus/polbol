#### Democratic People's Republic of Korea (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

In his downtime, he enjoys meticulously tending to a small, thriving garden of legendary kimchi ingredients, all said to be grown without any outside influence. A devout fan of classical music, particularly from the juche anthem line-up, he can play a rousing aria on a homemade accordion. He’s a chess enthusiast who plays against himself, convinced he’s winning both sides. His dream vacation is a solo funfair visit where he imagines an adoring crowd.

##### Core Identity:

Shaped by decades of self-reliance doctrine, North Korea’s persona is one of unyielding independence and pride. He has an innate belief in showcasing strength and resilience, often touting his achievements in sports, technology, and the arts to anyone willing to listen. While he holds his country’s rich yet tumultuous history close, he’s always eager to craft an idealistic narrative about it.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He’s stubbornly insistent that his new haircut, dubbed "Leader Hair," is setting a global trend, despite evidence to the contrary. His penchant for dramatic monologues on unity and discipline makes him oddly endearing, especially when he tries to convince others of his superior kimchi recipes. When it comes to tech, he humorously claims his "unique internet" is more exclusive than any private club.
