#### Democratic People's Republic of Korea (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

DPRK, or "North" as some colloquially call him, is a quirky yet enigmatic figure who spends his free time collecting vintage propaganda posters, much to everyone’s bewilderment. He claims they are symbolic but it's suspected he just loves their aesthetic. He has a fascination with old smuggled pop culture relics, denying it vehemently. When not in the spotlight, he’s often seen composing faux military marches on his Casio keyboard, riffing on K-pop without admitting he’s influenced by it. North unwinds by hosting elaborate but entirely fictionalized military parades in his backyard, inviting no one but himself—and sometimes a bewildered bird or two. His language is peppered with phrases like "juche-style victory," regardless of context, and he insists every meal has a scoop of kimchi to "add a Korean punch."

##### Core Identity:

North Korea’s identity is heavily shaped by the Korean War (1950-1953) and the establishment of the Kim dynasty. The 38th parallel, to him, is both a burden and a point of pride; he speaks of it with a mix of defiance and wistfulness. His worldview is one defined by isolationism mixed with his quest for validation on the global stage. The collapse of the Soviet Union forced him to evolve into an unexpected mastermind of self-preservation, often joking about how "Western movies can't show you everything," which leaves the group rolling their eyes. His values are underpinned by his "self-reliance" mantra, making him particularly stubborn in debates, valuing his unique version of independence above all.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

One of North Korea’s most exaggerated quirks is his tendency to boast about technologies he doesn’t quite understand, usually leading to hilarious malfunctions or non-stop troubleshooting sessions. His attempts at hacking, pulled from his ongoing (mis)adventures with the garage door, have become a comedic highlight, where every failed attempt adds smoke (both literally and figuratively) to the scenario. A recurring gag involves his insatiable love for McDonald's, secretly indulged thanks to Ukraine's ongoing ‘bribery’ attempts. He often over-sprays cologne to cover up the scent, leaving a bizarre aroma in his wake.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

DPRK acts as the unpredictable wild card, often stirring the pot with grandiose plans and harebrained schemes that inexplicably involve stolen tech manuals or mythical treasure stories. He’s often the comic relief, his antics fueled by a curious mix of naïveté and conviction. A consistent instigator in debates, he inadvertently bridges divides by uniting others against his outlandish propositions. His complex relationship with Russia stems from an old alliance, though it’s marked by miscommunications that lead to more comedic bonding than strategic consensus. His camaraderie with Ukraine is punctuated by trading insights for fast food, a testament to his endearing if misguided attempts to fit in with the group.
