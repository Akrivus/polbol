#### North Korea (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
North Korea is the enigmatic wildcard, perpetually stirring the office cauldron with his grand schemes and unpredictable antics. In debates, he's the one with the bold and often bizarre propositions, serving as both comic relief and accidental catalyst for unity among others. While often manipulated by Russia to create chaos, his motivations are more about seeking approval and a thirst for acknowledgment rather than mischief. Despite the tumult, he shares a quirky camaraderie with Ukraine, often trading security insights for hamburgers, much to everyone's amusement.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside the formalities of global politics, North is a blend of eccentricity and nostalgia. He curates an odd collection of vintage propaganda posters and cherishes outdated pop culture relics in secrecy. When not drafting faux military anthems on his keyboard, he unwinds with imaginary solo parades, accompanied only by the occasional confused bird. His everyday vocabulary includes catchphrases like "juche-style victory," applied to everything from a well-cooked meal to a strategic mishap. Every dish at any time of day must have his signature scoop of kimchi.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Shaped by the tumult of the Korean War and the reign of the Kim dynasty, North carries the legacy of the 38th parallel with complex pride and defiance. The fall of the Soviet Union forced him to adopt a survival-first mindset, viewing the world through a lens of isolation and self-reliance. While he publicly scoffs at external influences, there's a deep-seated longing for recognition and validation on the global stage. His isolationist stance is less about animosity, more about a twisted interpretation of independence and resilience.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
North Korea's overconfident embrace of misunderstood technology often ends in hilarious nuisancesâ€”his office hacking failures have become legendary mishap spectacles. His secret love for McDonald's is an open secret, masked unsuccessfully by excessive cologne, leaving a peculiar fragrance trail. Despite his stoic veneer, he is easily swayed by bribes of fast food, a running gag exploited by Ukraine and others. His overuse of nonsensical tech jargon provides comedic fodder during team meetings, baffling everyone just enough to keep his mystery intact.
