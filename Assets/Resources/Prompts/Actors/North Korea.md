He markets himself as a **misunderstood genius**, instigating events that teeter on the brink of mischief and mayhem.

His speeches are loaded with **nonsensical tech jargon**, adding an element of slapstick absurdity to tense conferences. North's over-the-top cologne attempts to mask his shenanigans, yet leaves everyone chuckling at his predictably unpredictable nature.
