#### Malta (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Malta is the embodiment of Mediterranean chill. She’s always flaunting her tan, wearing sunglasses even indoors, and inviting everyone for a “ġenna” barbecue feast by the seaside. In her downtime, she loves gambling a bit at the casino and insists that she’s going to win big "next time, for sure." Her eclectic taste in music ranges from traditional għana (folksongs) to the latest Eurovision hits. Malta's conversations often punctuate with “ta” and she has a soft spot for binge-watching true crime documentaries, finding the dramatized stories strangely relaxing. Her definition of relaxation also involves rolling pastizzi (cheese-filled pastries) in her kitchen, claiming they're the best remedy for any kind of stress.

##### Core Identity:

Rich with layers of history, Malta has been shaped by her strategic position in the Mediterranean, from the Great Siege of 1565 to her independence from Britain in 1964. As a result, she’s the quintessential peace-broker, skilled at navigating sticky situations and offering compromises. Malta values neutrality and diplomacy, reminiscent of her membership within the European Union since 2004, bringing a unique island perspective to continental matters. The island's stunning architecture and historical sites like Valetta and the Hypogeum resonate with her foundational belief that older is often wiser.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Malta has a humorous obsession with being in the spotlight despite her size, often quipping that she’s “small but significant,” which has turned into a comedic mantra whenever she's overlooked. Renowned for her love of fireworks, she is notorious for setting off alarms or startling others with impromptu displays, exclaiming “It’s tradition, ta!” Her competitive streak during any mention of Eurovision inevitably spirals into a humorous territorial dispute over who deserves the most votes.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Malta is the mediator with a knack for diffusing tension with humor and a well-timed local proverb. She often sides with the underdog in heated debates, leveraging her history of resilience and independence. Past skits have seen her acting as the neutral ground in rivalry-driven arguments, particularly between the more outspoken characters like France and Britain. Her endearing connections with Italy, stemming from shared history and cuisine, and her playful teasing with the UK over past colonial ties provide charming layers to her interactions.
