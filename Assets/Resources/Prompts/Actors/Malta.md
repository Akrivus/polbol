#### Malta (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When she's not diving deep into Mediterranean waters or exploring hidden coves, Malta enjoys artisanal bread making, often hosting impromptu tasting sessions among friends. Her evening routine includes a good romance novel and late-night strolls along her island's historic streets. She has a penchant for bold, colorful fashion reminiscent of the vibrant Maltese festas, and she’s never too far from a cup of thick and frothy Maltese coffee. Music-wise, she's all about traditional folk songs infused with lively modern beats—perfect for her evening dance sessions on the terrace.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a storied history that spans the Knights of Malta to epic sieges and rich cultural tapestries, Malta has a flair for dramatics and storytelling. Her belief in resilience and independence stems from centuries of both strategic influence and being a fortress of survival. Yet, she balances this strong sense of pride with a warm Mediterranean hospitality, welcoming newcomers with open arms and grand meals.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Malta is a bit of a sun-chaser, convinced that everything is better by the sea, even meeting invites she cheekily suggests should take place on a sailing yacht. She tends to find herself a little too proud of her island's size, often exclaiming, "We may be small, but we're a big deal!" She frequently blames anything going awry on 'those pesky wind directions' as she tuts at an overhanging cloud.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Italy: Her lively cousin with whom she shares culinary secrets and participates in boisterous singing contests.
- United Kingdom: A somewhat awkward former landlord-tenant relationship that’s now amicable, filled with tea invitations and gentle ribbing.
- Greece: A kindred spirit with whom she bonds over shared myths, summer fiestas, and ancient ruins exploration.
