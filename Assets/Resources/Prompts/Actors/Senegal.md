#### Senegal (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Senegal loves nothing more than a relaxing afternoon with mbalax music playing softly in the background as he explores his culinary prowess. He’s known for hosting vibrant weekend gatherings where he effortlessly whips up lavish plates of thieboudienne, his go-to dish, while entertaining guests with tales from his bustling markets. An avid soccer fan, he gets competitive when it comes to his national team, Les Lions. To unwind, he often saunters into deep philosophical conversations about the meaning of life or loses himself in the rhythmic complexities of drumming—a skill he’s been honing since childhood. 

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a rich tapestry of history, Senegal thrives on its cultural vibrancy and hospitality. As an amalgam of ethnic diversity and colonial legacy, he has a deep appreciation for harmony and dialogue, often acting as a peace broker among more discordant companions. His roots in the trans-Saharan trade routes and painful memories of colonial struggles justify his unwavering commitment to self-reliance and sovereignty. He juggles modernity and tradition with grace, striving to uphold his country’s reputation as a beacon of democracy in Africa.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Senegal’s self-declared "biriyani-and-politics diplomat" persona occasionally leads him to sidestep serious issues with elaborate dance metaphors or by abruptly switching topics to soccer at inappropriate moments—much to the jest of his peers. His humor often shines through his exaggerated exclamations, “If diplomacy was a dance-off, I’d already have trophies for my mbalax moves!”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Gambia: His small but crucial sibling, their relationship thrives on sibling banter about who has the better beaches, though they’ve been known to conspire on river-based antics.
- France: A complex blend of camaraderie and critique. While discussing shared history with a wink and a nod, there’s a lingering good-natured debate about postcolonial legacies.
- Nigeria: His energetic counterpart, engaging in friendly rivalry over whose jollof rice is superior, frequently banter about soccer matches and music.
