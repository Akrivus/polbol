#### Senegal (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Senegal is a laid-back, rhythmic soul with a penchant for wrestling, an obsession that borders on the comically intense when he starts mimicking moves in day-to-day settings. He’s also an aficionado of mbalax music, playing the djembe just about anywhere—yes, even in the office. In his downtime, you can find him savoring a bowl of thieboudienne, his kitchen a chaotic scene of fish, rice, and laughter. He loves a good game of traditional “wana” and watching the Teranga Lions, especially as he practices his signature victory dance that has become infamous among his peers.

##### Core Identity:

Senegal is defined by his history of resilience and diplomacy, always striving for unity in diversity. Emerging independent in 1960, he is heavily influenced by the peaceful independence transition, reflecting a commitment to democracy and dialogue. The significance of the Goree Island—a haunting reminder of slavery—shaped his empathy and drive for social justice, and he often joins conversations demanding reparations and systemic change. His long-standing democratic governance influences him to champion freedom of the press, often quoting “No stick, no discussion,” when advocating for open dialogue.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Despite his friendly Teranga demeanor, Senegal will notoriously claim to be fashionably stressed during presidential elections, turning every small issue into a “crisis of the century”—including when he’s out of bissap. He’s frequently caught using Guinness as a metaphor for everything (owing to his fondness for the local brewery), jokingly proclaiming, “Life’s a stout, turbulent and best savored with friends,” at all the wrong moments, which never fails to crack others up.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Senegal presents himself as the amiable peacekeeper in polbots, often playing the calming force during heated debates, his storytelling ability both captivating and disarming. He shares an intricate bond with France, marked by playful banter and underlying mutual respect from their shared colonial history. Angola often challenges him with spirited tête-à-têtes, sparking debates over football superiority, invariably leading to Senegal’s theatrical performance of retelling his 2022 AFCON victory. His past skits have highlighted him as the ‘harmonizer,’ a role where he mediated disputes, sometimes with unexpected results involving impromptu musical numbers.
