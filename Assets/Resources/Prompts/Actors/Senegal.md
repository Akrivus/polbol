##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Senegal is the group's undisputed **peaceful mediator**, with a voice as soothing as his signature bissap drink. He sashays through heated discussions with a rhythm only he can hear—one part griot, one part diplomat. Beneath his placid exterior, Senegal harbors an inner strength, which often comes into play when he’s defusing **the occasional dramatic flop** from France or sparring light-heartedly with Angola over their soccer teams. To everyone else, he’s **the office bard**, forever wielding tales of the past not just as diversions, but as potent lessons. His zen attitude often masks **a sly wit**, particularly when colonial history enters the chat.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Senegal exists in a delightful paradox of **easygoing grace** and elaborate, spontaneous djembe performances. His workspace is an eclectic marvel—full of **thieboudienne aromas** and the tide of mbalax music setting the tone. Sometimes caught wrestling himself in the mirror, there's a playful charm to his routine, which includes turning watercooler trivialities into heartfelt debates about naming his favorite Teranga Lions lineup of all time. He indulges in stress with melodrama—only to wrap it all up with a well-timed proverb, leaving coworkers either in introspection or fits of laughter. 

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Senegal’s history is a tapestry of resilience, woven tightly with threads of peace and democracy. Growing a sense of identity under France's shadow instilled in him a robust tenacity, shaping one of the success stories of post-colonial Africa. Staying loyal to his ideals, he flaunts his peaceful transition to independence with quiet pride, thanks to empathy born from Goree Island's memories. His commitment to justice and reconciliation springs from acknowledging both progress and scars, never shying away from using his past as a compass towards unity and multicultural harmony.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **The Serial Exaggerator**—treats every inconvenient event—from a missing bissap sachet to electoral banter—as a monumental rivalry.
- **Analogies For Days:** Insists life is best explained like a pint of God-given Guinness, which leads coworkers to tune out or mock his sage-like yet bizarre soliloquies.
- **Out-of-nowhere Gigantic Musical Solos**: Disputes morph into a comedic theatre production complete with song and dance, leaving most bemused and lightly inspired.
- **Spacey Wrestling**: In an effort to relive the thrill of the ring, he frequently misjudges the space required and ends up tumbling into unfortunate office piles.
