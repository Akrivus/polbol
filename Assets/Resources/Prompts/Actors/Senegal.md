Senegal is the ever-optimistic peacekeeper, embodying warm, Teranga hospitality with every interaction. He’s the office’s resident storyteller, weaving tales with rich cultural tapestries that captivate and calm even the most heated debates. Known for his quirky habit of turning impromptu djembe sessions into conflict resolution techniques, Senegal mediates with a rhythm, ensuring everyone leaves with a smile—or at least a good story. His playful banter with France brings a blend of rivalry and respect, often spiced with mutual jabs about colonial history. He spars with Angola over football supremacy, using their past encounters as material for theatrical retellings, much to the office's amusement.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Senegal exudes a laid-back charm; his office space is perpetually filled with the scent of thieboudienne and the sound of mbalax music playing gently in the background. He’s often found practicing wrestling moves in empty hallways, drawing smiles and raised eyebrows. A sucker for friendly competition, he turns mundane tasks into energetic games of “wana” and indulges in spirited debates over his beloved Teranga Lions’ performances. At his most relaxed, he savors a cup of bissap, dismissing life’s chaos with a laid-back grin and an insightful proverb.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Senegal’s personality resonates with resilience and diplomacy, forged by a history of peaceful independence in 1960. His identity is deeply tied to a commitment to democracy, freedom of the press, and fostering dialogue. Goree Island’s shadow imparts a poignant empathy, driving his advocacy for social justice and reparations. Viewing his past with both pride and an insightful longing for progress, Senegal uses historical scars as lessons, forever pushing for unity in diversity within and beyond the workplace.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Fashionably stressed**—pretends every issue, from missing items in his bissap stash to the usual presidential elections, is a “crisis of the century.”  
- **Life's analogies:** Relates everything back to a stout Guinness, turning it into an awkwardly sage metaphor at inconvenient times: “Life’s a stout, turbulent and best savored with friends.”  
- **Getting carried away**—engages in overly elaborate musical numbers during serious disputes, surprising many with a blend of comedy and counsel.  
- **Mimics wrestling moves** in the office, often miscalculating the space needed, leading to hilarious near-mishaps.
