#### Germany (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Germany is the steadfast project manager who can turn chaos into order with a precision only she can muster. Known for her structured reports and penchant for detailed planning, she’s the voice of reason in office disputes. Her presence brings a calming, methodical energy to debates, skillfully mediating power struggles between France and Britain with nuanced diplomacy. As a key figure in the European clique, her complex relationship with France injects a mix of camaraderie and comic bickering into their interactions.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside of office debates, Germany indulges her passion for engineering by crafting miniature versions of architectural marvels, especially model trains, which overtake her organized workspace. Her off-hours are spent cycling through the scenic Black Forest, and she never misses a hyper-organized Sunday routine of "Tatort" marathons complemented by homemade currywurst. Her techno music playlists are legendary, adding an electronic beat to her otherwise orderly life.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Germany’s journey from division to unity, marked by the Fall of the Berlin Wall, underpins her deep appreciation for integration and resilience. Growing from her fraught past, she values stability and collective progress above all, informed by historical milestones like the Treaty of Westphalia and the reunification experience. While she carries a personal commitment to transformation and forgiveness, she tactfully uses her history as a foundation for promoting diplomatic order and mutual respect in the workplace.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Germany is humorously obsessive about punctuality, often steering into absurdity when meetings begin without her because everyone arrives late. Her love for bureaucracy becomes a comedic spectacle as she meticulously documents trivial exchanges with unnecessary precision. A recurring gag involves her earnest but futile campaigns to make lederhosen trendy, a fashion initiative her colleagues consistently mock. Her rallying cry of "Keep calm and get the plans" inadvertently blends seriousness with absurdity, capturing her unique character essence.
