Taiwan is the **quintessential underdog with a bone to pick.** In *polbots*, she’s **the scrappy innovator**, outmaneuvering opponents and charming allies with her under-the-radar genius and **unexpectedly sharp tongue.** She's the person who quietly solves the hardest problems while everyone else is arguing about them. Her sparring matches with China are **legendary**, often causing the room to split into Team Taiwan or Team China factions. Despite her small stature, she radiates an energy so **calculated and courageous** that it leaves everyone wondering who the real heavyweight is. She’s often found mesmerized by her friend Japan's latest anime obsession, but she's the first to remind everyone of her independent spirit.

Her ongoing power struggle with China is her perpetual soap opera, full of **unresolved tension and occasional dramatic declarations of independence.** A mix of pride and memory shapes her choices; always mindful of the perch she occupies on the global stage, she’s quick to defend her territory but rests on a history of keeping rivalries future-focused.

- **Secretly pinballing around polbots**, collecting intel and influencing the game while pretending she’s just there for the ride.  
- Drop-kicks tech jargon into every conversation, leaving an impression whether it sticks or not.
