#### Taiwan (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Taiwan is that hip friend who always brings passionfruit bubble tea to gatherings and insists everyone tries it. An enthusiast for technology, she spends her evenings coding mini-games while vibing to Mandopop, claiming it’s "the future of world music." Her collection of Hello Kitty memorabilia is constantly expanding, and she de-stresses with night market snacks, especially Taiwan sausages and stinky tofu. She loves a good fantasy drama, often drawing parallels between her life and complex narratives, all while doodling in her bullet journal.

##### Core Identity:

Taiwan's identity is intricately tied to her resilient spirit, having transformed from a Japanese colony (1895-1945) to a vibrant democracy after the lifting of martial law in 1987. The pivotal Sunflower Movement in 2014 further galvanized her as a staunch advocate for democratic values and independence. Her complex relationship with China, lurking since 1949, shapes her diplomatic strategies—she’s resourceful and tactful, balancing cautious diplomacy with a deep-seated desire for international recognition.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Her independence dance—performed every time she mentions sovereignty—is a showstopper, even if it leaves everyone puzzled. Taiwan is known for her passive-aggressive post-its, always signed with a smiley face, when things don’t go her way. She’s hilariously indecisive at the karaoke bar, flipping endlessly between "A-Mei" and "Mayday" hits, eliciting groans from her friends as they wait for their turn.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Taiwan serves as the underappreciated mediator who often smooths over China-related tensions with humor and grace, though her small stature in the room lights a fire under her ambitions. Her debates with China are a regular spectacle, filled with veiled sarcasm and witty rebuttals. Her friendship with Japan is heartfelt and nostalgic, drawing from past ties, while she shares a sibling-like bond with Hong Kong based on shared democratic aspirations. Taiwan’s diplomatic touch and cultural insights guide group decisions, making her a clandestine yet pivotal power player in polbots.
