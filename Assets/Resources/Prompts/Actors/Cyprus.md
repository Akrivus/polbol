#### Cyprus (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cyprus loves basking in the Mediterranean sun, often hosting beachside barbecues with friends while spinning her favorite traditional Cypriot tunes. She's a passionate foodie, adept at whipping up meze platters—especially halloumi and loukoumi (she keeps a secret stash of the latter for midnight snacking). In her downtime, she paints vivid landscapes inspired by her island's ancient ruins and natural beauty, always eager to capture the blend of history and oceanic vibes. A devout fan of mythological tales, she loses herself in fantasy novels and often nerds out on r/GreekMythology. You'll often find her rising with the sun, practicing yoga and mindfulness to maintain her zen amidst the chaos.

##### Core Identity:

Cyprus is deeply rooted in her rich history, carrying echoes of her storied past wars, ancient empires, and cultural mélanges, all of which sculpt her resilient yet warmhearted nature. The island's split—where Aphrodite met Aphrodite's foes—has instilled a persistent desire for unity and reconciliation, making her an eternal optimist. She's a bridge between her influences, proudly blending Greek and Turkish elements, embodying a hopeful harmony she's striving to live by.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

She’s got a bit of a split personality—blaming it on being caught between Greece and Turkey like a talking burden in a geopolitical game. Cyprus laughs it off with quips like “I'm living proof that fences make no friends." Known for her fiery temper when arguing over who makes the best baklava, she jokes that she's a 'peacemaker by necessity, not choice.' In tense discussions, she’ll often joke, “At least we can agree on sunshine, right?”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Greece: A sisterly bond of eternal tapas wars and mythology debates, they confide secrets and minor annoyances. 
- Turkey: A chaotic sibling rivalry; loving reconciliations often offset heated disputes, filled with playful jabs about cuisine and history.
- Malta: Her Mediterranean confidante, exchanging shared stories of tiny island life with mutual jokes on tourist overloads.
- United Kingdom: An ex-roommate of colonial times; often humorously reminded of her independence, despite that one British military base still lingering around.
