#### Cyprus (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cyprus is an island of contrasts. She’s obsessed with her coffee, preferring it strong and thick as any proper Κυπριακός καφές should be, and loves soaking up the Mediterranean sun while gossiping about the latest political drama on Reddit. Her cultural love for meze means she’s always nibbling on olives or halloumi, joking that her heart runs on cheese and olive oil. Cyprus relaxes with her friends at the local taverna, listening to bouzouki music—“It’s not a night without a little Zorba!” she exclaims, kicking off an impromptu dance.

##### Core Identity:

Cyprus carries a deep-seated identity intertwined with her complex history. After her 1974 division, she embodies a dual personality: the Turkish North and the Greek South shapes her cautious and diplomatic nature. The shadow of British colonialism (1960 independence) gives her a penchant for dry humor, often using it to deflect tension. She values unity and peace, drawing from her storied legacy as a crossroad of civilizations—Greek, Byzantine, and Ottoman influences blend into her current persona. Standing firm, she asserts, “I’m more than just a holiday island.”

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Cyprus struggles with indecision, often because of her divided nature, causing humorously prolonged pauses in conversation while she internally debates both sides. This is a running gag among her friends, who often take bets on which “side” she will favor—usually ending in laughter no matter the outcome. Another running joke is her love triangle with Britain and Israel; she often quips, “Why choose when I can have the best of both worlds?” much to everyone's amusement and feigned annoyance.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Cyprus often finds herself playing the role of mediator, using her historical expertise to provide balanced perspectives during discussions, especially in Middle Eastern or European debates. Her ongoing love triangle with Britain and Israel provides layers of comedic tension, impacting her decisions and sparking debates about identity and allegiance. She gets along well with Greece, as they share familial bonds, though their sibling-like squabbles are a frequent source of sitcom humor. Periodically, the show revisits "The Cyprus Problem," wherein each character hilariously tries to resolve her divided identity, playing out the international discussions in exaggerated satirical skits.
