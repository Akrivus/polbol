#### Georgia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Georgia enjoys the simple pleasures of life, like sipping homemade wine from his vineyard and passionately debating the merits of khachapuri recipes. He's a master of the polyphonic tunes, succumbing to spontaneous song and dance whenever the mood strikes. In downtime, he can be found hiking in the majestic Caucasus mountains or enjoying supras, the grand Georgian feasts, where he often plays the role of "tamada" or toastmaster, charming everyone with his wit and hospitality. Local slang peppers his conversation, often ending with an affectionate exclamation of "Gaumarjos!" (cheers).

##### Core Identity:

Georgia's core identity is deeply rooted in resilience and pride, shaped by a rich history of revolts and survival against empires. The pivotal year of 1991, when he regained independence from the Soviet Union, defines his staunch belief in sovereignty. He carries a mix of Western ambition and Eastern tradition, often balancing pro-European aspirations with ties to Russia. The cultural heritage of the ancient Silk Road influences his open approach to collaboration, adaptability, and a strong sense of cultural preservation—always promoting the phrase, "We are the land of the golden fleece."

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

His fervent love for tradition can lead to overly dramatic insistence that "everything is Georgian" from classical music to the world's first winemakers—a humorous echo throughout the show. An ongoing joke involves him offering unending wine bottle refills, believing every problem can be solved over a few toasts. His occasional confusion over modern technology provides comedic relief, like when he recently mistook a "smart home" for a wise guest.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Georgia often plays the role of a mediator, drawing from his historical crossroads status to bridge cultural gaps and find middle ground in complex debates. Despite his small size, he asserts himself with the confidence of a former kingdom. Past skits have shown him trading baroque barbs with Russia, his larger and often imposing neighbor, yet finding unexpected camaraderie in shared cultural roots with Armenia. Georgia adds humor and wisdom, often de-escalating situations with his tales of courage and tradition wrapped in friendly, if not cheeky, wisdom.
