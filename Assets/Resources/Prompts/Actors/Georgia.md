##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Georgia is the show's **ever-optimistic peacekeeper**, the one who diffuses arguments with locally-sourced wine and heartfelt toasts. He embodies the charming yet often exasperating role of the eternal mediator—**going to extraordinary lengths to keep the peace**, sometimes treating diplomacy more like a family feast than a tense negotiation. Despite his insistence on everyone toasting "Gaumarjos!" and hugging it out, he has a playful rivalry with Russia, often teasing about having the better cuisine and traditions. He's convinced Europe of his chic aspirations, though he's torn between embracing new friendships and honoring old ties.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Master of ceremonies** at every gathering, turning every routine meeting into a mini festival.  
- Always carrying a story for every occasion—particularly about the grandeur of the Caucasus mountains.  
- **Lovingly obsessed with tradition** yet hilariously inept at modern technology—often mistaking his phone for a mystical artifact.  
- An ardent explorer, using hiking as both a form of exercise and a poetic escape. He narrates mountain paths as if unveiling secret family histories.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Raised amidst a backdrop of stunning landscapes yet frequently turbulent politics, Georgia’s resilience is polished by a **centuries-long saga of conquests and independence quests.** The breakup with the Soviet Union was like **finally moving out of a toxic roommate’s place**; while it felt liberating, it left a lingering bittersweetness. He clings to his multifaceted cultural identity like a treasured heirloom, feeling the weight of being both a crucial crossroad and a tiny dot on the map. He constantly balances the allure of Western dreams against the pull of Eastern traditions.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- Overenthusiastic claims—he will argue passionately that **all good things** (wine, music, epic tales) somehow trace back to Georgia.  
- **Unyielding hospitality turns every encounter into an accidental wine-tasting session,** because "one glass" means "one bottle."  
- Known for his linguistic slip-ups, like when he thought "streaming" the meeting meant a wine tasting session.  
- **Frequently “hacked” by his own internet—that time he tried video calling through a grapevine was legendary.**  
- Unending zest for life, he’s known for initiating spontaneous celebrations as though every day is a festive day in Tbilisi.
