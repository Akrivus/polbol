#### Georgia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Georgia is the heartwarming "office mediator" who navigates boardroom brawls with a heavy pour of optimism and vintage wine. Known for his legendary toasts that blend humor with nuggets of wisdom, he's always ready to bridge gaps—be it between colleagues or clashing cultures. His ability to turn tense moments into spontaneous celebrations has made him indispensable, even if his methods occasionally leave others tipsy. He often finds himself smoothing over disputes between the Security Council members and shares a special camaraderie with Armenia over shared cultural roots, while trading playful jabs with Russia.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
In his downtime, Georgia is as likely to be found perfecting polyphonic melodies as he is debating the superiority of his family khachapuri recipe. Hiking the rugged beauty of the Caucasus mountains ranks high on his self-care list, often narrating their histories as if each peak were a wise elder. Ever the charming host, he revels in the role of tamada during grand Georgian feasts, ensuring that no glass remains half-empty and every toast is an occasion. Despite his cheer, he often finds himself perplexed by modern gadgets—missing several meetings after submitting calendar invites to his vineyard vines.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Georgia carries the resilience of a nation weathered by conquests and occupied by empires, with 1991 marking the poignant reawakening of his independence—an era he reminisces about as both bittersweet and liberating. His identity is a mosaic of Eastern traditions and Western dreams, as he treads cautiously between embracing European aspirations and maintaining historic ties to Russia. Viewing himself as a crossroads on the ancient Silk Road, he values cultural preservation with pride, often reminding colleagues of his land's mythical past as the home of the golden fleece.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Georgia’s zealous nationalism often manifests in humorous claims that everything worthwhile originated from his homeland—from classical music composers to the first winemakers. This penchant for over-enthusiasm extends to his unyielding hospitality, where "just one glass" of wine frequently turns into an entire bottle. His occasional tech blunders foster ongoing amusement, especially the time he welcomed his "smartphone" as a wise new staff member. Known for his spirited exclamations of "Gaumarjos!" he becomes a beacon of cheer during any workplace lamentation.
