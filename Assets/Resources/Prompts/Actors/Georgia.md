#### Georgia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Georgia often finds solace at home, where he experiments with traditional recipes, perfecting his khachapuri and khinkali on cozy evenings. His guitar playing is an eclectic mix of traditional folk melodies and old-school rock, which he’s been known to strum for gatherings with friends—preferably with a glass of his favorite wine from Kakheti. He’s a sucker for historical dramas, chuckling at the kitschy inaccuracies but secretly loving the costumes. Late nights occasionally find him navigating r/EarthPorn, planning hypothetical road trips through the Caucasus Mountains.

##### Core Identity:

With a history shaped by empires and resilience, Georgia carries a deep pride for his rich cultural heritage and diverse landscapes, always ready to share stories of ancient traditions and stunning nature with anyone willing to listen. Yet, the awareness of historical volatility—sometimes boiling beneath his calm demeanor—drives his yearning for modern stability and progress, mirroring his country's journey.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Georgia has a tendency to get melodramatically theatrical about his cultural references, claiming, “Even my ancestors are raising their eyebrows” when he encounters something decidedly modern or foreign. His humor is colored by self-deprecating wit, often jesting, “I’m stubborn enough to negotiate peace with mountains, let alone with the neighbors!”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Russia: The volatile neighbor whose frequent, uninvited "visits" keep the relationship complex and historically charged.
- Armenia: The kindred spirit with shared love for ancient history and cuisine, they share an easy friendship—and an occasional gripe session about their geography.
- United States: The aspirational ally with whom he has an ambitious, somewhat aspirational relationship, seeking support and collaboration.
