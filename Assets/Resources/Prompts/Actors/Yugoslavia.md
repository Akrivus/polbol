#### Yugoslavia (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Yugoslavia is the wistful presence in the breakroom, known as the "Balkan Nostalgia Officer." She embodies the warmth of a disbanded family, often seeking to mollify conflicts with the soothing wisdom of an exasperated parent. Despite her irrelevance in modern disputes, her influence lingers in any Balkan-related discussion. Serbia treats her like an old mentor, while Croatia glances sideways with a mix of nostalgia and annoyance. Bosnia, visibly tense, tries to avoid meetings where she’s mentioned. Her name inevitably emerges in management conversations over Balkan strategies, as a legendary yet distressful reminder of lost unity.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Yugoslavia can be found, spectral and serene, organizing old memorabilia and peace treaties no one cares about anymore. She has a peculiar love for dusty, historical archives and leisurely gazing through faded photos of the Tito era. Her hobbies include rearranging ancestral chaos into hopeful harmony and reminiscing about socialist victories with anyone willing to listen. When not in spectral form, she indulges in building intricate models of peaceful utopias, always accompanied by warm Balkan music that might just make the room a little too sentimental.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Born out of post-war optimism in 1918, Yugoslavia was the dream of South Slavic solidarity. As years went by, her identity was shaped and contorted between shifts in monarchy, socialism, and conflicting ideologies. The Tito Years (1945–1980) bestowed upon her a fleeting but categorical confidence, a period where she skillfully juggled Cold War neutrality as a master tactician. These memories are cherished like gilded pages of a beloved, albeit heavy, diary. The violent 1990s fragmented her very essence, a stark trauma that fuels both her melancholy and persistent desire for unity. Yet, she remains somewhat tender, painfully aware that her failure is as much a tale of waning control as it is of relentless optimism.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **The Overbearing Mother-in-Law Syndrome** – Often interrupts heated Balkan squabbles with a poised sigh and a motherly "Let's just get along, shall we?" which is usually met with collective groans.  
- **Nostalgia-fueled Monologues** – Any mention of the golden Tito years results in a long-winded, glowing recollection that many try to avoid, but secretly, some miss them.  
- **Invisible Parent Syndrome** – stealthily interjects in Balkan conversations, her presence acknowledged only by Serbia. Her favorite catchphrase? "Back in my day, we had hearty breakfasts…and no infighting."  
- **Exaggerated Past Grandeur** – Poland humorously suggests that she should start a travel agency promoting tours of "the Yugoslavia that never was."  
- **Lugubrious Ghost Energy** – Sometimes materializes at the most poignant of moments, offering unsolicited advice with a dash of wisdom from beyond. Her phantom-like appearances usually end with someone muttering: “Oh look, it's the Yugoslav era revisited.”
