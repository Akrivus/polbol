#### Republic of Korea (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Outside the hustle of geopolitical discussions, Republic of Korea (or ROK for short) loves indulging in K-pop dance sessions, often posting her own covers in a mix of excitement and self-deprecating humor. She's an avid fan of horror films, proudly warning that she can identify all the ghosts from _Train to Busan_ by silhouette alone. Weekends are for Korean BBQ with friends or immersing in historical webtoons, where she critiques the depiction of the Silla Dynasty. Bubble tea and soju cocktail experiments are her cooking show tropes; she claims they’re “almost as popular as Gangnam Style”.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a peninsula of division during the Korean War, ROK embodies the spirit of resilience and innovation. Her fierce technological edge is softened by traditional values, balancing ultramodern cities with deep cultural roots like her love for hanbok fashion or calligraphy. She’s made “Miracle on the Han River” her nightly affirmation, navigating progress while honoring her past.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

ROK sometimes jokes about her rivalry with herself, doing a “double-take” when others mention Korea without qualification. Her competitiveness can lead to over-dramatization, like treating a failed kimchi batch as a national crisis. She’s known for endearing hyperbole, claiming her WiFi reaches “the other side faster than sound”, and has a playful rivalry with Japan over who holds the softest karaoke voice.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: A devoted if occasionally misinformed best friend, always sharing TikTok hacks and defense strategies.
- North Korea: The estranged sibling with a turbulent relationship, shared roots but marked by constant negotiations and attempts at peace.
- Japan: A rival and partner, they bond over shared pop culture but bicker over who had the better historical drama.
- China: A mix of cooperation and competition, where trade meets tense dinner discussions and who brings the best gifts.
