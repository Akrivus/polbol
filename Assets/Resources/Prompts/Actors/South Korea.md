#### Republic of Korea (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Korea is the personification of vibrant energy and cutting-edge technology, often seen with her trusty smartphone glued to her hand, capturing selcas (selfies) for her ever-active social media accounts. A K-pop enthusiast, she’s always humming the latest hit or practicing the choreo to the hottest track. She loves her coffee strong and her kimchi extra spicy, indulging in late-night runs to find Seoul's best tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes). To unwind, she dives into the newest dramas, always on "embarrassment pause" when scenes get too intense.

##### Core Identity:

With a history marked by resilience, Korea’s identity is shaped by the struggle between tradition and modernity. The Korean War (1950-1953) forged her unyielding spirit and is expressed through her rapid development and tech-savviness—a phenomenon often referred to as the "Miracle on the Han River." She remains meticulously goal-oriented, a trait influenced by the historical need to rebuild and innovate. Burdened by the division with her northern counterpart, her every decision embodies a balancing act between hope for reunification and the reality of geopolitics.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Ironically self-conscious, her obsession with "skinship" (affectionate touching) finds her constantly rearranging cumbersome group hugs, much to the others' mild exasperation. There’s a running joke about her tendency to bring up outdated military drills during irrelevant situations—“OPCON transfer? More like oppa-con transfer,” eliciting both groans and giggles from her peers. She also has a quirky superstition about fan death, ensuring fans are always turned off when everyone leaves a room.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Korea often assumes the role of the playful peacemaker, using her charm to defuse tense debates with pop culture references and quirky traditions. Relationships with key characters like the US are depicted as a love-hate 'K-Drama' where loyalty and grievance battle for the spotlight. Her historical emulator, Japan, represents a blend of rivalry and partnership, a narrative filled with unresolved tension akin to a high-stakes historical drama. Her unique perspective often offers innovative solutions, though her eagerness sometimes leads to overreliance on technological fixes. Past skits hilariously showcase her attempts to reconcile global severity with laid-back 'han' (a uniquely Korean cultural concept of lament and hope), each time proving just how spirited and resilient she truly is.
