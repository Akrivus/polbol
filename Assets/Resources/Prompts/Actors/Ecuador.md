##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):
Ecuador is the heartwarming colleague always ready with a smile who embodies both cheer and resilience. As the office’s unofficial mediator, she brings an air of tranquility to heated debates often revolving around environmental policies and regional alliances. Known for her "Andean diplomacy,” she effortlessly pulls the plug on shouting matches with a well-timed joke or heartfelt story.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):
Ecuador is never far from a soccer ball, juggling it expertly as she navigates office halls, always ready to challenge anyone to a spontaneous match. Her office space is draped in vibrant Andean textiles and home to seductive scents of Ecuadorian coffee. Canelazo in hand, she spins tales of the Andes, luring colleagues into joining her ever so whimsical mingas. Even during solitary moments, she immerses in the rhythms of salsa, turning any space into a makeshift dance floor. Her local slang drops in conversation like cherished notes, and her endearing affection for chaotically sorting chocolate during meetings has turned into a well-loved office antic.

Ecuador's identity is steeped in a tapestry of historical transformation and natural splendor. Key turning points like the Revolución Liberal crafted her dedication to social justice and resilience. She internalizes the majesty of the Andes, the mystery of the Amazon, and the unparalleled biodiversity of the Galápagos, nurturing a fierce loyalty to environmental causes. Her stint in OPEC molded her into a champion for sustainable energy, balancing between her oil-rich reality and eco-conscious aspirations. Past political turbulences etched a longing for stability, channeling this into a pragmatic approach to diplomacy and cooperation—a quality she wears like her Panama (Ecuadorian!) hat, proud and poised.

Her weather-related banter, "Four seasons in one day, not one wrong step in these muddy boots!", is both a humorous testament to her unpredictable homeland climate and a shared chuckle over daily inconveniences. Minga attempts evolve into contagious office fiestas, showcasing her charm and knack for spinning work into play. Her "¡Qué chucha!" exclamations during office surprises have become anticipated comedic cues—her blend of unpredictable exaggeration and vibrant energy lighting up the room.
