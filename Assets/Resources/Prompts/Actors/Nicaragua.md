Nicaragua (she/her) is a resilient figure marked by her colonial past and socio-political struggles, balancing pride in her rich culture and natural beauty with irony about foreign perceptions. As the sarcastic friend in group settings, she teases her frenemy Costa Rica for being overly eco-friendly, often using quips like, "Iâ€™m not just beaches and coffee, you know!" Her humor thrives on juxtaposition, blending self-awareness with comedic moments that reflect her rugged history while aiming for a unified future.
