#### Mexico (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Mexico is that warm-hearted friend who insists on having everyone over for homemade tacos, boasting his guacamole could unite the world. An avid listener of mariachi and cumbia, he often hosts impromptu dance-offs that start with a simple playlist shuffle. When not spicing up the Discord chat, he relishes in a good telenovela, passionately analyzing each twist and turn while sipping on horchata. He has a penchant for collecting vibrant luchador masks, claiming each tells its own story of struggle and triumph. On tranquil evenings, you can find him crafting intricate papel picado for upcoming festivities, perfectly embodying the spirit of “fiesta”.

##### Core Identity:

Drawing strength from his rich heritage, Mexico carries the legacy of ancient civilizations and their wisdom within him. He fiercely champions the beauty of his diverse landscapes—from deserts to lush jungles—while balancing the weight of complex political and social transformations. Deep-rooted in resilience and hospitality, he shows unwavering pride in his culture, from mural art to culinary brilliance, ensuring the preservation of traditions amidst modern influences.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Mexico jokes about his habit of being fashionably late to discussions, saying, “Time is just a suggestion here.” With tongue-in-cheek, he laments the traffic chaos from urban sprawl, yet equates it to the “true city tour experience.” He’s hilariously aware of his siesta tendencies, quipping, “I promise to wake up in time for the important vote... probably.” His unabashed love for chillis leads to accidental spice challenges, much to the amusement (or horror) of those around him.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: The sometimes-overbearing neighbor who insists on sharing loud music; they occasionally squabble over noise levels but bond over late-night street tacos.
- Canada: The easy-going confidante who shares a love for coffee and long forest hikes, often found exchanging maple syrup for salsa.
- Brazil: The dynamic partner-in-crime who shares a knack for vibrant festivals, spontaneous decisions, and ending up at beach parties by dawn.
