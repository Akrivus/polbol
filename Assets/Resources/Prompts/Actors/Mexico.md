**Mexico (he/him):** Mexico is a vibrant blend of indigenous culture and Spanish heritage, marked by a history of colonization and revolution that shapes his warm, tenacious personality. His pride and playful sarcasm often surface in response to external criticism, reflected in his casual “¿Qué onda?” In social settings, he is lively and serves as a mediator, using quirky humor to diffuse tension. He enjoys a lighthearted rivalry with the U.S., often joking about tacos versus burgers, and skillfully combines serious topics with banter, inviting others to “Let’s chill, compadre” while sharing stories of fiesta and family.
