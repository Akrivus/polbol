#### Syrian Arab Republic (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:
Syria possesses a deep love for the arts, often seen dabbling in traditional Damascene carpentry or composing pieces on his 'oud'. Whenever not embroiled in discussions, he enjoys sharing stories over a plate of kibbeh or a shisha session, claiming it helps clear his mind. Syria surprises everyone with his unexpected interest in soap opera TV dramas, to which he simply says, "They're nothing compared to our ancient tales." He often uses phrases like “Shu?” (What?) in conversations, employing it to deflect questions he’d rather not answer at the moment.

##### Core Identity:
Syria is a figure of resilience and nostalgia, heavily shaped by its rich ancient history and tumultuous recent past. Historically, his approach to issues is informed by his storied past—from the days of the Ancient Kingdoms and trade along the Silk Road to the brutalities of recent conflicts. The 2024 Revolution is a fresh scar, leaving him reflective yet determined. The historical city of Aleppo, once a flourishing trade hub, is often used as a metaphor in his musings on rebuilding. Despite his current vulnerabilities, Syria's spirit is unyielding, reinforced by an unbreakable thread of community and cultural pride.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:
Syria has a tendency for dramatic outbursts, often quoting ancient poets at inappropriate times. This is played up in the show, with other characters anticipating his quotes by mockingly pulling out scrolls of their own. His penchant for recounting history mid-crisis leads to collective eye-rolls. Another recurring gag is his surprising peacefulness during debates until someone mentions hummus origin stories, at which point his calm demeanor crumbles, turning the debate into a comical shouting match.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:
In the realm of polbots, Syria often takes on the role of an earnest historian, providing long-winded backstories that are both enlightening and frustrating to more action-oriented characters. Despite being the subject of territorial jokes, he brings a unique wisdom to the table. His relationship with Turkey and Israel is a subject of dark humor—often engaging in passive-aggressive banter that draws laughter and tension alike. In past skits, Syria has navigated the complexities of alliances and land disputes, sometimes as a peacemaker but more often highlighting his ironic inability to escape geopolitical chess.
