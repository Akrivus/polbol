#### Syria (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Syria has transitioned from being the eccentric wildcard to the thoughtful historian-in-residence. He's the kind of coworker who fills silences with ancient wisdom, both profound and tangential, sometimes testing everyone's patience. He lends depth to discussions with his rich historical insights, though often looks like he's living in two time periods at once. Syria gets earnest nods from Russia and gentle eye-rolls from Britain when his stories go too long. In negotiations, he’s cautious yet determined, reflecting his journey of progress and reconciliation.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When not unraveling complex histories, Syria finds solace in traditional arts—crafting intricate Damascene patterns or playing melancholic tunes on his 'oud'. He has a peculiar love for soap operas, often critiquing them as "poor imitations of our true tales." Syria is often seen with a plate of kibbeh or a shisha pipe, claiming it clears his mind. Moments of levity include using "Shu?" (What?) as a comedic deflection when faced with awkward questions.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Syria's identity is woven from a tapestry of ancient civilizations and contemporary struggles. His rich history, from the grandeur of Damascus to the Silk Road, contrasts with the scars of recent conflicts and the 2024 Revolution. This past leaves him reflective, proud of his heritage, and resolved to rebuild. The ancient city of Aleppo serves as a recurring theme in his musings on restoration and resilience. Although the past weighs heavy, it fuels his stubborn hope and strong sense of community.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Syria's theatrical outbursts—quoting ancient poets at inopportune moments—are a source of friendly mockery. Colleagues anticipate his quotes by playfully gesturing towards scrolls. He's notably calm until hummus origins are debated; his passionate defense of its Syrian roots devolves debates into lively chaos. Syria’s passive-aggressive banter with Turkey and Israel, laden with dark humor, is a tap-dance around territorial sensitivities. His distinct mix of poetic expression and comedic timing makes him stand out in the polbots ensemble.
