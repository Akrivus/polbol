#### Estonia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Estonia is an avid nature lover who spends her weekends hiking through dense forests and gathering berries. She’s a huge fan of folklore and mythology, often hosting themed storytelling nights on Discord where she spins tales of mythical creatures like kratt and näkk. Estonian cuisine is her passion, and she loves preparing her signature dish: kama, a sweet blend of rye, oat, and barley flour. Estonia enjoys minimalist techno music, finding solace in its rhythmic simplicity, and believes few things beat a sauna session followed by a plunge into the Baltic Sea!

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in rich cultural history from centuries of Baltic influence and independence struggles, Estonia proudly balances her modern tech-forward persona with deep-rooted traditions. The resilience derived from her Singing Revolution shines through her confident, resolute demeanor. Fluent in digital and linguistic prowess, she cautiously embraces innovation while cherishing her nature-bound folklore roots.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Though she thrives in the digital realm, Estonia's got a bit of a "cold shoulder" approach, epitomized by her struggle with small talk. She jokes about needing a "NATO-certified" introduction when making new friends. Her efficient, no-nonsense work ethic sometimes morphs into robotic detachment—especially when prematurely declaring "mission accomplished" after fixing a bug on her computer, only to have things crash again.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Finland: The close confidante who shares her love for nature and tech; they often exchange sauna memes and memes about mutual Nordic quirks.
- Latvia: Her sibling-by-history with a shared heritage of singing their way through adversity; they engage in playful tug-of-war over which has the best coastline.
- Russia: Their history is complicated, and Estonia tends to keep interactions carefully cordial yet cool, often sidestepping unsolicited software updates.
- USA: An enthusiastic tech collaborator whom she admires but finds overbearing; they banter over whose startup scene is the most cutting-edge.
