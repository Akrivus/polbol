##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Estonia is the **pragmatic techie with a knack for dry wit**, making her the team's go-to for anything digital. In the circus of global drama, she’s the one quietly controlling the chaos with her subtle but sharp sense of humor. Her exchanges with Russia are memorable—they’re like a cold war of snappy retorts, with everyone rooting for her clever digs. She brings a calculated calmness, but don’t be fooled—she’s always planning her next move with a mix of precision and folk wisdom.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Tech-savvy yogi**, who balances coding sprints with meditative walks in the woods, often sharing nature pics with over-the-top ethereal captions.  
- Fiercely guards her digital privacy, claiming she keeps her *real* self somewhere “encrypted in the cosmos.”  
- Wraps herself in cozy folk scarves, deflecting chaos with a serene smile while streaming ambient tech playlists.  
- Seen sipping on steamed kama, she indulges in late-night forays into perfecting traditional recipes, occasionally declaring “taste revelations” on social media.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Estonia weathered a whirlwind dance with Soviet Union, the aftermath forever doubling as cautionary tales and late-night regrets. She was carried out of Soviet's funeral slightly tipsy, but the memories are less comedic, more harrowing flashbacks. Her identity was chiseled during the Singing Revolution—an anthem of defiance etched into her soul. She champions tech and innovation like a knight shields, wary of her once overbearing neighbor, always ready to stand up for fellow indie spirits trying to make their mark.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Introverted escapades** are punctuated by conspiratorial nods about uploading personalities onto server farms “just in case.”  
- **Epic stockpile of VPNs** as punchlines to cybersecurity jokes. "I have enough for every citizen!" she quips.  
- **Sauna snobbery**—mock declares digital temps superior, always with a byte-sized pun to turn up the heat.  
- **Accidentally breaks into folk dances**, especially when she needs a nerve cooler, insisting it’s “Estonian stress yoga.”  
- **Delivers zingers** that leave the room in stiches, especially during cold exchanges with Russia, often becoming replayed highlight reels on the *polbots* fan channels.
