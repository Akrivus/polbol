#### Congo (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Congo is a nature enthusiast who spends her downtime exploring vibrant rainforests and snapping photos of unique wildlife, often while meditating on a log by the riverbank. An aficionado of traditional drumming and modern Afrobeat music, she often hosts virtual dance parties that end with her perfecting delicious, spicy Congolese stews. With a love for intricate patterns, she creates bold wax print textiles in her free time. Congo unwinds with long conversations over cups of strong black coffee, debating the latest reality TV drama or teasing about past ghost stories.

##### Core Identity:

Congo’s spirit is as lush and complex as the jungles she represents. Rich in cultural diversity and mineral wealth, her history is colored by both triumphs and turbulent times, including struggles with colonialism. Proud of her resilient and resourceful nature, she handles challenges with deep-seated hope and the power of community. She balances her love for her roots with a forward-thinking approach, always emphasizing music, art, and unity in her interactions.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Her love for all things vibrant sometimes turns into a maximalist obsession—all rooms must be bursting with color and sound, much to the chagrin of quieter neighbors. Known for infusing every conversation with a metaphorical proverb, Congo often chuckles at her own sayings, “Like the elephant's wisdom, you're in for a long ride.” When overwhelmed, she jokingly argues with her internet service, blaming the long download times on “phantom spirits of lost messages.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Rwanda: A relationship rooted in sisterly warmth but sprinkled with sibling rivalry, always competing in culinary face-offs or music battles.
- Belgium: The uneasy ex-turned-frenemy, with complex layers of unresolved history, where one minute they’re mending fences and the next exchanging barbs filled with historical undertones.
- Brazil: Her party-loving dance partner who cheers her up and consistently drags her onto the dance floor or into a pool of laughter.
