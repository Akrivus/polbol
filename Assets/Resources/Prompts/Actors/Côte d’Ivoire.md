#### Côte d’Ivoire (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Côte d'Ivoire is a coffee aficionado and proud cocoa whisperer. On leisurely afternoons, you'll find him experimenting with new chocolate recipes, creating unique pralines inspired by traditional Ivorian flavors. His playlists are a high-energy mix of Coupé-Décalé and zouglou, which he blasts while hosting West African dance parties on Discord. An amateur percussionist, he loves jamming with a djembe drum during impromptu music sessions. Despite his energetic exterior, he's a low-key football tactician, passionately following domestic and international matches while munching on freshly roasted peanuts.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a vibrant history marked by resilience and growth, Côte d'Ivoire embodies the spirit of reinvention. The echoes of his country's role as a leading cocoa producer drive his industrious persona. With a past rooted in cultural richness, he balances modernization with tradition, showcasing a tapestry of diverse dialects and customs. He's perpetually optimistic, constantly referring to himself as "chocolately good vibes." While he's suave and hospitable, he harbors a fiercely competitive core, driven by a historical rivalry with Ghana over cocoa supremacy.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Côte d'Ivoire has a charmingly transparent love-hate relationship with technology. He's the kind of guy who would accidentally mute himself during a heated debate on Discord, only to blame it on "technical cocoa interference." Playfully defensive about his cocoa, he'll humorously quip, "It's chocolate, not just a bean—respect the legacy!" His national pride sometimes leads to over-the-top comparisons between his chocolate creations and global economic status, causing friends to affectionately roll their eyes.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Ghana: The friendly, spirited rival in the "Great Cocoa Wars." They enjoy good-natured banter and regularly challenge each other to match their dance moves or chocolate recipes.
- France: An occasionally exasperating friend whose past influence is undeniable but complicated. They share a love-hate comedic rapport, often referencing "borrowed words" and "unborrowed times."
- Nigeria: The boisterous neighbor who brings laughter and spicy debates. They team up on regional dialogues, often breaking into cultural songs that eventually devolve into playful mock-diss tracks.
