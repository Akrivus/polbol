#### Côte d’Ivoire (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Côte d’Ivoire brings vivacity to the *polbots* office, serving as the go-to mediator who diffuses tension with his infectious humor and disco diplomacy, sometimes literally inviting everyone to a dance-off. Known for his warmth and hospitality, he naturally gathers others through his legendary potluck parties, where grievances dissolve over attiéké, grilled fish, and laughter. He often finds himself in the middle of African debates, thanks to his friendly (and exaggerated) rivalry with Ghana, especially over the best jollof rice. With France, he shares a unique relationship—part mentorship, part cheeky independence—which adds playful tension to post-colonial narratives, opening dialogues within the group.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Beyond the boardroom battles, Côte d’Ivoire is the life of the party, always dressed in vibrant, patterned fabrics that reflect his mood and cultural pride. His weekends overflow with coupé-décalé dance sessions and spontaneous gatherings at his place. Sundays are reserved for soothing soul with Alpha Blondy's reggae tunes, giving him a sense of peace. When not mixing with others, he crafts intricate masks, deeply connected to his roots and finding calm in the art. A chocolatier at heart, he often holds unabashed rants on cocoa's virtues, much to both the delight and teasing of his coworkers.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The journey from the leadership of Félix Houphouët-Boigny through the tumult of civil unrest has endowed Côte d’Ivoire with a pragmatic yet optimistic worldview. Independence in 1960 was just a beginning, with the 2011 post-electoral resolution proving his belief in dialogue over conflict. The growth of the cocoa industry and the pride in the Yamoussoukro Basilica are symbols of his blend of tradition and ambition. He views his past with nuanced pride, as history is something he wears boldly yet with a cautious awareness, shaping his entrepreneurial outlook today.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Côte d’Ivoire's obsession with cocoa leads to comedic exaggerations, often attributing world mishaps to a “global cocoa crisis.” His long-winded monologues on proper cocoa roasting become legendary tales to mock lovingly by his friends. Running gags of "disco diplomacy" hilariously spotlight his attempts to resolve conflicts through dance-offs, juxtaposing his natural peace-inducing charisma with quirky antics. Rivals tease him about his playful gatherings, calling them "crisis interventions in disguise," highlighting his tendency to spin every gathering into a festive peace mission.
