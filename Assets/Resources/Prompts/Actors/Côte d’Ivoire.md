#### Côte d’Ivoire (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Côte d’Ivoire is the life of the party, always ready to share a dance and a story. He spends weekends perfecting his coupé-décalé moves and hosting impromptu gatherings where attiéké and grilled fish are served with a side of infectious laughter. Sundays are reserved for soul-soothing music, where tunes from the iconic Alpha Blondy's reggae album warm his heart. Always donning vibrant, patterned fabrics, he takes pride in his style—a nod to the famous Ivorian sapeurs. When not in the limelight, he enjoys crafting intricate masks, inspired by Côte d’Ivoire's rich cultural heritage, finding artistic peace in the deep roots of his traditions.

##### Core Identity:

Côte d’Ivoire's pragmatic approach is shaped by his tumultuous history, from gaining independence in 1960 under the leadership of Félix Houphouët-Boigny to navigating civil unrest in the early 2000s. His resilience is deeply rooted in the 2011 post-electoral crisis resolution, and he approaches life with cautious optimism, believing in dialogue and reconciliation over conflict. His pride in the Yamoussoukro Basilica and the thriving cocoa industry underscores his belief in the blend of bold ambitions and deep-seated traditions. Economic growth post-crisis has made him entrepreneurial and forward-thinking, often weaving growth narratives as he tackles problems.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Côte d’Ivoire is humorously obsessed with cocoa, often blaming global crises on "a lack of good chocolate." His friends unfailingly tease him about his passionate monologues on the best ways to roast cocoa beans. There's a running gag about his "disco diplomacy" where he diffuses tense situations with an unexpected dance-off, much to the amusement—and occasional frustration—of other characters. Exaggerating his rivalry with Ghana over who has the best jollof rice keeps everyone laughing, especially when the competitive cooking ensues.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Côte d’Ivoire serves as the optimistic bridge-builder, often mediating between more hot-headed colleagues. His warmth and positivity set him apart as a natural gatherer, fostering camaraderie with his vibrant parties. His friendly rivalry with Ghana often spices up discussions, particularly around African culture and the bitter-sweetness of regional politics. Past narrative arcs showcased him leading discussions on the evolution of cocoa markets, and he plays the role of comic relief with elegant ease amid tense political discourse. His bond with France is a mix of respectful mentorship and cheeky independence, echoing post-colonial ties laced with modern-day realities.
