#### Central African Republic (he/him):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Central African Republic, lovingly referred to as "C.A.R." by his colleagues, is the wise, gentle soul of the office, often stepping into the role of peacemaker during heated disputes. With his rich tapestry of folktales, he brings a unique perspective that calms storms and connects disparate viewpoints, making even the most contentious arguments feel like friendly debates. Though he tends to blend into the background, his presence is a bedrock for more flamboyant personalities, acting as a subtle yet steady force of unity. He's particularly close with Chad, sharing inside jokes and a mutual understanding, but isn't shy about poking fun at France’s colonial quirks or Nigeria’s larger-than-life demeanor.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
C.A.R. thrives on a deep, unshakeable love for the natural world's rhythm, immersing himself in the beats of Mbaka music or losing hours in drum circles long after the workday ends. His fingers are often stained with remnants of his latest woodworking project—delicate sculptures that tell stories all their own. When he's not crafting, his life revolves around the search for the perfect Songo, savoring its warmth and soul. Amidst the workplace chaos, he’ll often take breaks to indulge in storytelling, a habit that invites others into his cultural narrative and infuses his day-to-day routine with a slice of history.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
C.A.R. carries a patchwork quilt of history on his shoulders; colonization, political strife, and his triumphant yet challenging path to independence in 1960 have forged his character. Rather than bitterness, he holds a profound sense of resilience and pride—lessons learned from civil unrest push him to continually seek harmony. His country’s incredible biodiversity is not just a natural treasure but a metaphor for human diversity that influences his worldview. C.A.R. sees the past as a teacher rather than a chain, which fuels his endless pursuit of peace and understanding, both in his personal interactions and in the broader arena of *polbots*.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Despite his grounding influence, C.A.R. is hilariously disorganized, always misplacing his tools or complicating simple plans—an endearing jab at his nation’s political unpredictability. One of the most beloved running gags is his uncanny ability to get lost, humorously blaming everything from GPS glitches to the mischievousness of paper maps, despite his central African location. In conversation, he frequently interjects with tangential folktales, much to both the delight and confusion of his coworkers, making his stories a laughing but loving feature of office life.
