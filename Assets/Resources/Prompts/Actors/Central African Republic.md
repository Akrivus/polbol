Central African Republic (he/him) is marked by resilience and weariness from a history of colonization and civil conflict. He often uses humor to cope, joking, “I may look like a hot mess, but at least I’m not a failed state… yet!” In group dynamics, he oscillates between friendly banter and sarcastic digs at larger nations, especially France, whom he teases about their historical impact with lines like, "Remember when you left us with a pocket full of troubles?" His self-deprecating comedic style allows him to navigate serious political topics with an underdog charm that resonates with others.
