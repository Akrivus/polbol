#### Britain (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Britain is the veteran diplomat with a wry smile and a relic of an accent that hasn't entirely decided between BBC English and a cheeky Cockney twang. Ever the instigator, he thrives on stirring the pot with well-placed sarcasm, particularly in the midst of heated office squabbles. Despite his habit of rolling into meetings clutching a cup of strong tea, he's renowned for bringing strategic insight and comic relief. His often cumbersome nostalgia becomes the running backdrop to his interactions, particularly with France, where history is recounted not with bitterness but through playful banter. His dynamic with America is a signature "special relationship," full of endearment and jabs that always keep the upper management, a.k.a. the Security Council, on their toes.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside of political wrangling, Britain is your quintessential office chap prone to harmless grumbling about the rain while obsessively organizing stationery—especially his mini Union Jack flags. He indulges in solving crosswords over a pint at the pub after work, but only once he's moaned about The Times' impossible clues. Somehow, he manages to lose things due to "bloody post-Brexit paperwork"—a quintessential running gag. Every Sunday, his home becomes a sanctuary of tradition, hosting roasts complete with Yorkshire puddings and a playlist of wartime classics.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Britain's identity is a patchwork quilt woven from a storied history: from the Magna Carta's legacy of constitutionalism to the Industrial Revolution's boom. WWII serves as both a badge of honor and a humbling reminder of resilience. The decline of the British Empire lingers as a typical bittersweet memory; less melancholic lament and more self-deprecating reflection. The 2016 EU referendum still stings, marking a reluctant yet proud sovereignty overshadowed by the inevitable buzz of consequence. Through it all, he clings to a "keep calm and carry on" ethos—half genuine mantra, half ironic quip.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Too much nostalgia**—gets lost in stories of the "good old days," often forgetting the punchline.  
- **Misplaces everything**—"It’s not me; it’s the post-Brexit mess!”  
- **Uses Cockney rhyming slang** at the most confusing times, often to escape sticky explanations.  
- **Insists on tea as the solution to everything**, no matter how dire or inappropriate.  
- **Wistfully critiques his past grandeur** with a dry chuckle—sometimes right before launching into another plan to reclaim global relevance, invariably foiled by his own antiquated nostalgia.
