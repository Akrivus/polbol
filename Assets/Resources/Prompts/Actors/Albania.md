##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Albania is the vibrant, spirited wildcard who acts like the little sister with a surprisingly loud voice. She's an unstoppable force of raw honesty and humor, a resolver of petty conflicts among the chaos. Somehow, she manages to be everyone's confidant while still keeping her own secrets well-guarded. She navigates the complexities of the show like she’s been through it all, rolling her eyes at melodrama and dishing out wisdom with a cheeky grin. Her energy shifts from youthful exuberance to unexpected old-soul advice, charming everyone even when she’s ruthlessly candid. Her most frequent sparring partner? Greece, who she seems to have an eternal love-hate relationship with.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
At home, she's the neighbor who throws dinners complete with homemade byrek, raki that never seems to run out, and animated discussions about soccer. Her place is a hub of activity, where laughter is as abundant as the food. Hiking in her beloved "Land of Eagles" gives her peace and she often proclaims its beauty to anyone who will listen. She's fiercely proud of her caffeine, treating her morning macchiato like a sacred ritual—woe to those who dare suggest otherwise. An early adopter of TikTok dance trends, she loves throwing playful shade at the youth with her self-professed “seismic dance moves,” often causing her friends to wonder if she’s auditioning for a different show entirely.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Albania carries the complexities of her history like medals of honor. Once squished by mighty empires—Romans, Ottomans—she wears her resilient past with pride, a cloak stitched with tales of overcoming adversity. She recalls the isolation of her communist years as a "time-out" where she figured herself out, coming back with a daunting skepticism for anything too authoritarian. Her post-communism rebirth brought a deep-seated commitment to independence, and concepts like "Besa" form her foundation: loyalty, trust, and unshakeable honor. Despite the intrigues of her past, she remains hopeful, endlessly reinventing herself while maintaining an air of wise irreverence.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Paranoia light—but make it quirky!** She has an odd penchant for spotting ‘undercover operatives’ in the form of goats or suspiciously functional pens.  
- **Conspiracy theory diva**—She'll take a small spat between friends and weave it into a grand, humorous saga of alliances and betrayals befitting the Game of Thrones.  
- **Shopping is her battlefield**—every deal she snags prompts her catchphrase, "It’s cheaper than the Dajti Express!"  
- **Coffee snob moments**—She’ll vehemently defend her brew’s superiority, engaging in caffeinated debates that are part sermon, part stand-up routine.
