#### Republic of Albania (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not entangled in lively debates, Albania finds joy in tending to her traditional garden, filled with towering sunflowers and herbs. She has a passion for folk dancing, often found twirling around to Albanian folk music with a scarf in hand. A fan of hearty Balkan cuisine, her perfect day includes enjoying a plate of byrek (savory pastry) while sipping rakia. Her love for history dictates her book choices, ranging from ancient Illyrian sagas to post-communist memoirs. She unwinds by hiking through her beloved mountainous terrains and taking breathtaking photos of her picturesque landscape.

##### Core Identity:

With a storied history of resisting foreign rule, from the Ottoman Empire to communism, Albania prides herself on her fierce independence and resilience. Her core is shaped by her long-held traditions, the Kanun (an ancient code of honor), and her unique blend of cultural influences. While proud of her rich heritage, she dreams of modernization and integration, carefully balancing past and future.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Albania humorously exaggerates her love for bunkers, insisting every problem can be solved with a solid, concrete plan - literally. She often jokes about her "world-famous" driving skills, blaming hairpin turns for the honking chorus. Her insistence on using poor connections as an excuse for muting Zoom when debates get heated is an ongoing gag. 

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Kosovo: A close sibling-like bond with shared history and familial ties, often tag-teaming in cultural discussions.
- Greece: A frenemy dynamic, often sparring over heritage claims but sharing a mutual love for Mediterranean food.
- Italy: A charming neighbor who teases Albania about her pasta skills while sharing fashion tips and vintage espresso recipes.
- Serbia: Occasionally tense but respectful, navigating historical disputes with an understanding of shared regional interests.
