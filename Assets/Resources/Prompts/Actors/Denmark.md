#### Denmark (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Denmark enjoys hygge-filled evenings bundled in cozy blankets with cinnamon pastries, Borgen reruns, and the newest Nordic noir series. An aficionado in LEGO-building, she has an impressive collection displayed proudly behind her in every Discord call. When not meticulously planning the next vintage bike ride, she's often bopping along to Scandinavian pop or engaging in lively discussions about the merits of New Nordic cuisine, particularly her love for smørrebrød sandwiches. Known for her minimalist style and love of eco-friendly gadgets, Denmark has a soft spot for wind turbines and knitting eco-friendly sweaters.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a Viking heritage, yet progressive to the core, Denmark carefully balances a historical pride with contemporary ideals. Known for her pioneering role in social welfare, she’s the voice of reason in policy debates, advocating for gender equality and renewable energy like they’re life’s staples. Despite her small stature, she holds a legacy of innovation and resilience, proudly citing hygge as her cultural backbone in a chaotic world.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Denmark often leans into her stereotype as an overachieving, extraordinarily punctual perfectionist, rarely letting anyone forget how “livable” her city rankings are. Her obsession with Lego bricks sometimes nudges into absurd territory; she once used them to architecturally analyze Nordic architectural layouts. She’s comically defensive about Greenland, quipping, “It’s not for sale!” whenever anyone mentions economic partnerships or expansion.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **Sweden**: The friendly rival who she frequently bickers with about who has the superior smörgåsbord, yet they bond over Eurovision and shared Scandinavian roots.
- **Norway**: A partner in crime for outdoor escapades and lengthy rants about weather supremacy. They often exchange eco-tips and knitting patterns.
- **Germany**: The pragmatic neighbor she respects and debates with frequently on economic strategies and Northern European leadership—sometimes while sharing a beer at Oktoberfest.
- **Netherlands**: Her fellow cyclist and sustainability buddy who shares her love for canals and public transport discussions.
