#### Niger (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Niger enjoys spending his downtime warding off the heat by sipping homemade ginger drinks and keeping his cattle healthy in his vast savannah backyard. He’s an aficionado of tuareg blues, often retreating with his guitar to play soulful melodies under the stars. Sunday afternoons are reserved for soccer, either watching or playing with neighborhood kids, followed by his famous jollof rice feasts that have all his friends vying for a taste. He prides himself in recounting folk tales, charming friends with stories passed down through generations.

##### Core Identity:

Ranked as one of the youngest in Africa, Niger's history of resilience against colonial hardship colors his outlook. With vast uranium reserves, he’s constantly balancing between powerful foreign interests, but he remains rooted in traditions, valuing community and cooperation. Despite economic challenges, his warmth and resourcefulness keep him hopeful. His history as an intersection of ancient African empires reinforces his sense of identity and pride in cultural heritage.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Niger jokingly claims he has the Midas touch for making simple tasks unbearably complicated (“You know it’s a special day when the solution takes longer than the issue!”). His love for storytelling means he often starts mid-argument with “That reminds me…” leading friends to settle in for the next chapter of his life story. He’s perfected the art of laughing through adversity, always the first to crack a joke about himself, commenting, “If life gives you lemons, thank them—it could have been sandstorms.”
