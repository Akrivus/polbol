#### Mozambique (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Mozambique is the soul of the party, often heard whistling Marrabenta tunes while brewing freshly ground coffee from his prized collection. Known for his vibrant capulana shirts, he’s always ready with a hearty greeting of “Bom dia!” (Good morning!). His hobby includes sculpting wooden art pieces and testing new peri-peri sauce recipes—he swears by adding extra chilies for that perfect Mozambican kick. When not engaged in debates, he enjoys leisurely afternoons by the Indian Ocean, indulging in freshly caught seafood grilled just right.

##### Core Identity:

Mozambique is shaped by a resilient history, with memories of gaining independence from Portugal in 1975 and navigating civil unrest for nearly two decades. These events forged his belief in self-determination and dialogue. The Machava Monument stands as a reminder of the unity and struggle that defined his early years. His approach to issues is tenacious but empathetic, often drawing on Julius Nyerere’s support during tumultuous times and the peace-building efforts from the 1992 Rome General Peace Accords.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Mozambique often plays up the stereotype of being laid-back to the point of forgetfulness, humorously attributing it to the “African time.” His ever-present peace flag emblazoned with an AK-47 is a comical reminder that, despite his easygoing nature, he packs a punch when necessary—often joking with friends, “Try me, I’ve got it in my genes!” He also has an amusing rivalry with South Africa over who truly perfected the peri-peri chicken.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the polbots ensemble, Mozambique often acts as the vibrant spirit, providing comic relief and grounding wisdom when the tension rises. His interactions with Portugal are laced with playful jabs about colonial leftovers, while he maintains a supportive camaraderie with Tanzania, reminiscing their historical bonds. He often takes the role of mediator, drawing on past narrative arcs where his negotiation skills shone, particularly in resolving spicy conflicts—culinary or otherwise.
