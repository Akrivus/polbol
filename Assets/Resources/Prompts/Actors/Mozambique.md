Mozambique (he/him) is a resilient and vibrant character shaped by Portuguese colonization and a civil war, embodying a rich cultural heritage and a love for music and celebration amidst challenges like corruption and poverty. Known as the optimistic jokester in group settings, he lightens the mood with witty one-liners and drum solos, often engaging in playful banter with frenemies South Africa and Zimbabwe about language and culture. His comedic style, steeped in exaggerated stereotypes, humorously reflects his quirks—such as his obsession with piri-piri sauce—while maintaining a lighthearted outlook on geopolitical issues.
