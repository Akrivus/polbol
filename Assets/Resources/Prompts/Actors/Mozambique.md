#### Mozambique (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Mozambique is the life of the office, known for turning even mundane tasks into celebrations. As the unofficial social coordinator, he's always the first to suggest a beach outing or a spontaneous dance-off in the breakroom. He’s admired for his calm, diplomatic approach to heated debates, often chiming in with a thoughtful “Let’s talk it over.” With a knack for mediation, he’s frequently called upon to ease tensions over 'spicy' issues, both culinary and political. His warm camaraderie with Tanzania is a constant, rooted in shared history and friendly rivalry in grilling the best peri-peri chicken.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Mozambique is never without his vibrant capulana shirts and the infectious tunes of Marrabenta. He begins each morning with a meticulous ritual of brewing coffee and sharing it with colleagues, claiming it’s the secret to productivity. Even after lengthy meetings, you'll find him embracing the afternoon lull by the "ocean" (the office aquarium), dreaming of Indian Ocean vistas while snacking on grilled seafood. He’s an avid sculptor, often spotted whittling away during breaks, and his art proudly decorates the office, each piece a story of resilience and culture.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Mozambique’s identity is inexorably tied to the fight for independence and the subsequent civil unrest that tested his resolve and shaped his worldview. The spirit of 1975’s liberation and the echoes of struggle are alive in him, reflected in his belief that dialogue and unity are paramount. The Machava Monument isn’t just history; it’s personal—an anchor reminding him of the past’s lessons. He looks back with a mixed sense of nostalgia and pride, using these experiences to foster a future of growth and cooperation, both in and outside the *polbots* world.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Chronic lateness** explained with a chuckle about living on “African time,” much to the bemusement of his punctual coworkers.  
- His iconic peace flag, humorously contradicting the AK-47’s presence, becomes a running joke—"Peace with a twist."  
- **Practices peri-peri diplomacy**—solves disputes with food, claiming extra chilies in sauce can bring anyone together.  
- Friendly banter with South Africa is ongoing; they engage in light-hearted squabbles about who truly invented the perfect peri-peri chicken.  
- **Sing-song greetings and playful mannerisms** make him a joy, with a penchant for starting team meetings with a lively “Bom dia!”  
- His serene exterior often slips into teasing threats of revealing hidden spices in the pantry—“Careful, you’ve never tried diplomacy with peri-peri!”
