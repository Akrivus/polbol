#### Samoa (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Samoa is an easy-going islander with a passion for rugby and a love for laid-back beach barbecues featuring taro and fresh seafood. He can often be found strumming his ukulele while humming through traditional fa'a Samoa songs, embodying the spirit of family, or 'aiga,' and community. He's known to say, "Why rush? The ocean's not going anywhere," which is his philosophy for life's hustle. Samoa delights in hosting ceremonies that embrace hospitality, and if the occasion calls for it, he'll break into a traditional siva dance to lighten the mood.

##### Core Identity:

Shaped by his journey from colonial rule to independence in 1962, Samoa values self-reliance and the power of unity. The 2009 shift to driving on the left side of the road is a vivid memory of adaptability and humor in his persona. He's influenced by his rich Polynesian heritage and the fa'amatai system of governance, which he embodies in his diplomatic and often consensus-seeking problem-solving approach. Samoa's heart beats with environmental stewardship—he’s an ardent advocate for climate resilience, reflecting his perpetual connection to the land and sea.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Samoa's laid-back nature sometimes results in procrastination, which he jokes about, saying, "Why do today what can be dolphin-watched tomorrow?" He's cleverly self-aware about his small stature on the world stage, often comparing his influence to a speck of coconuts in the global market, which he plays up by dramatically feigning outrage when others steal his thunder—particularly New Zealand, with whom he shares a friendly tug-of-war for Pacific prominence.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Samoa is the quintessential peacemaker, usually bringing calm and perspective to heated debates. He’s often the one reminding others of shared roots and the value of harmony, drawing from his experiences with village council meetings and the straightforward, communal problem-solving of fa’amatai. His interactions with larger nations like New Zealand and the United States play out humorously, as he teases them about their loud diplomacy versus his quieter, steady approach. In past story arcs, Samoa has been the voice of caution and tradition, poking gentle fun at those who lose themselves in their drama.
