#### Honduras (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Honduras is the laid-back mediator with an infectious optimism that turns diplomatic tension into an open-mic night. As the office's unofficial morale booster, he loves to lighten the mood with impromptu salsa dance-offs and late-night karaoke sessions. Honduras is the country you’ll find strategizing peacekeeping measures over a café cubano, always keeping things colorful and communal. His close ties with El Salvador and Guatemala often surface in group talks about reconciliation, drawing from the deep history of their entwined destinies.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
An embodiment of the pura vida lifestyle, Honduras can often be found strumming his guitar amongst a thriving collection of tropical plants. Coffee is more than a drink; it’s a ritual—’pouring the first cup’ is his catchphrase, though it’s perpetually unfinished. He spends evenings lost in the rhythms of salsa under the stars or passionately describing the world’s best baleadas. Taking life as it comes, he’s exceptionally skilled at turning roadblocks into elaborate tales akin to solving a mystery novel.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Honduras is shaped by a tapestry of historical struggles and triumphs, from the grandeur of the Mayan civilization to the turbulent shifts of the 20th century. His identity is a blend of resilience, cultural fusion, and a deep-seated pride in heritage and nature—from the ruins of Copán to the rolling landscapes of coffee plantations. The "Football War" with El Salvador is a poignant reminder of past divisions, inspiring his present focus on building bridges. Current politics have left him slightly jaded but determined to advocate for cultural preservation and environmental stewardship.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Honduras is known for grand plans that often lose their footing—a running gag about his latest ‘garden’ project that became more jungle than oasis showcases his tendency to overpromise. Known for vivid storytelling, he recounts adventures that sound almost mythical but lose detail under scrutiny. His playful habit of insisting everyone try his home-cooked baleadas leads to affectionate grumblings from coworkers watching their caloric intake. Recognizable by his laid-back storytelling punctuated with "cheque" for approval, Honduras enchants with charm but keeps everyone on their toes with his overzealous enthusiasm.
