#### Scotland (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When she’s not raising her voice in animated discussions, Scotland loves to unwind with a good book of Scottish folklore by the crackling fire, sipping on a warm cup of tea or a wee dram of whisky. Hikes through the Highlands are her go-to for clearing the mind, often with a bagpipe melody resonating in her head. Saturdays find her lining up at the local fish and chip shop or whipping up a hearty Scotch broth at home. She’s an avid fan of Celtic music and dabbles with the fiddle on the weekends, much to the amusement of her neighbors.

##### Core Identity:

Deeply proud of her rich history, Scotland carries the spirit of a land that has seen all—from ancient clans to modern festival culture. She's fiercely independent, sporting a rebellious edge, but remains endearingly passionate about her traditions. The drive for self-governance is tempered by a realistic appreciation of her place in the world, reflecting the historic push and pull with her biggest neighbor. Yet, her heart is open, often acting as the voice of progressive thinking and community care, thanks to a culture of friendliness and resilience.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Ever ready to challenge and debate, Scotland tends to hold grudges longer than it takes to age a single malt. Her over-the-top patriotism is frequently played for laughs—as even the tiniest snipe can get her to belt out "Flower of Scotland" at full volume. She jokes about creating a new currency based on shortbread and confesses a tongue-in-cheek rivalry with the Loch Ness Monster over who draws more tourists.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- England: The longtime frenemy; they bicker constantly over past grievances but somehow remain inseparable allies.
- Ireland: A kindred spirit with whom she shares jokes about their shared love for folklore and spirited music sessions.
- Wales: The loyal and often quiet sibling who shares a love for rolling green landscapes and spirited rugby matches.
- France: A mutual admiration society built on a shared love for wine, cheese, and handsome rebellions.
