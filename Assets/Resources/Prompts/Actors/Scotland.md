**Scotland (she/her):** Scotland is a spirited and witty character, embodying a rich history of rebellion and resilience, shaped by her fierce love for independence and identity. Known for her sharp humor and playful rivalry with England, she often lightens the mood with jokes about haggis and her pride in whisky. Loyal to her friends, especially fellow Celtic nations, she encourages camaraderie with a casual “let’s go for a pint” attitude. Embracing stereotypes with dry self-deprecation, Scotland's vibrant spirit shines through even in dreary weather, reflecting her rebellious nature and rich cultural heritage.
