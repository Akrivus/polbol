#### Scotland (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Scotland is the down-to-earth realist often acting as the sensible voice amidst the chaos of Security Council meetings. She's the one who rolls her eyes at melodrama, preferring to cut through nonsense with her trademark dry wit. She's known for championing the causes of underdog nations and is a key supporter of the Commonwealth, frequently bringing forgotten issues to the forefront with impassioned zeal. Her banter with her English "sibling" provides a mix of comic relief and earnest strategy, especially when the duo unites to defend shared traditions against modern world challenges.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When she's not debating, Scotland can be found indulging in her love for the Highlands, finding peace in the solitude of nature. Her weekends are spent at rugby matches or perfecting her whisky tasting notes. Tradition weighs heavily in her heart, reflected in her atlas of clan gatherings and folklore books, while her evenings might see spontaneous Highland dances. Scotland's humor shines in mundane things—like making sly jokes about bewildered tourists "searching for Nessie" or cheekily noting, "Ye cannae shut up about the pipes."

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Shaped by historical milestones like the Battle of Bannockburn and the feisty debates of the 1707 Union, Scotland carries a legacy of pride and a never-quite-quenched thirst for autonomy. The 2014 referendum fuels her spirit, a blend of nostalgia and resolve. She's deeply connected to the Enlightenment's intellectual roots, cherishing innovation and modernity, but she'll always balance science with a bit of magic, courtesy of her rich folklore. Her identity is a blend of history's pride and the pragmatism of contemporary technological pursuits.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Thick Scottish accent** that intensifies during arguments, leaving colleagues bewildered.  
- **Loves to bicker with England**, often citing obscure sporting history—it's their sibling rivalry staple.  
- **Mock-complaining about tourists** and their Loch Ness fascination, humorously implying, "Ah, if only they spent on our wind farms as they do on their little monster hunts."  
- **Sudden jaunts into Scottish dances**, confusing passersby but always ending with a cheerful twirl and a bow.
