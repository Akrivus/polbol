#### Palestine (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Palestine tries to embrace a sense of normalcy amid the chaos. He's often seen tending to his small collection of olive trees on the apartment balcony, calling it his "little piece of home." He loves cooking traditional dishes like maqluba or musakhan whenever he gets the chance, humorously lamenting the lack of a proper kitchen due to Israel's renovations. He's got a knack for storytelling, weaving tales of heritage and resilience to anyone who'll listen. Quirky and sentimental, he'll reference famous poets like Mahmoud Darwish in heartfelt speeches or during moments of introspection.

##### Core Identity:

Palestine's core identity is shaped by decades of conflict and perseverance. From the 1948 Arab-Israeli War to the Oslo Accords of the '90s, his narrative is one of resistance and a perpetual quest for recognition. The historical turning point of the Nakba (1948) deeply influences his interactions, instilling a sense of longing and loss. The frustration of being caught in a political stalemate reveals his complexity—he's fiercely proud but weary. These events have taught him to value community and solidarity, although it often reads as stubbornness.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Palestine has a habit of breaking into impassioned monologues, occasionally missing the forest for the olive trees. His romanticized ideas about his homeland and future lead to humorous escapades where his plans never quite go as intended. A running gag involves him trying to navigate the ever-looming stacks of paperwork from various peace talks, which inevitably tumble down, prompting an “Inshallah, next time!” as he attempts to clean up the mess.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Palestine embodies the role of an emotional advocate. He often finds himself at odds with Israel, injecting the reality sitcom with tense yet heartfelt undercurrents. Despite their fraught relationship, there are moments of reluctant camaraderie, especially when dealing with meddlesome third parties like the United States insisting on peace deals. Palestine has an evolving friendship with Egypt, often bonding over shared cultural ties, though strained by present circumstances. His presence adds depth to debates on autonomy and identity, while his tenacity offers a poignant counterbalance to lighter narratives.
