#### Palestine (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not embroiled in debates, Palestine finds solace in gardening, often tending to his olive trees and rolling his own za'atar (a Palestinian spice, thank you very much.) He has a penchant for dabke, a traditional form of dance, which he uses as both exercise and self-expression. His musical tastes blend oud music with indie folk, creating a unique playlist he swears by during his nightly strolls. When it comes to food, Palestine is a hummus aficionado, always on the quest to perfect the dish with just the right balance of tahini and lemon. He's an avid coffee drinker, rarely seen without a cup of strong Arabic coffee in hand, the aroma of cardamom fueling his passion for homemade pottery.

##### Core Identity:

Defined by a history of resilience and deep cultural roots, Palestine embodies the strength of enduring against all odds. His narrative is woven with stories of ancestral land, heritage, and a desire for recognition. Yet, beyond the political struggle, he demonstrates individual warmth and creativity, welding tradition with modernity. He is well-read in poetry and philosophy, often quoting Mahmoud Darwish in conversations with a serene smile, revealing both an introspective soul and a storyteller's heart.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Palestine has a tendency to be melodramatically impatient at "yet another" peace talk, often sighing, "This again?" with an exaggerated eye roll. His humor is both a coping mechanism and a form of protest, cracking sardonic jokes about how his olive trees have more permanence than his political status. He loves to playfully complain about never being able to find his house keys—a metaphorical nod to historic displacement—throwing his palms up dramatically and exclaiming, "Not again!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Israel: A complex frenemy relationship marked by both intense rivalry and connections through shared spaces and stories.
- Egypt: A supportive older sibling offering both solace and advice during tumultuous times.
- Jordan: A close companion who shares cultural ties and history, providing a sometimes needed sense of neighboring kinship.
