#### Houthi (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Houthi is a hardened survivor with the charm of a back-alley brawler and the hospitality of a warlord who just found out it’s lunchtime. He claims to enjoy simple pleasures—chewing qat, sitting in the hills, and watching drones fly overhead like they’re pigeons—but his idea of relaxation often involves launching missiles at passing ships. He calls it “stress relief.” When not actively antagonizing the West, he rants about imperialism, reads outdated Soviet military handbooks, and brags about his uncanny ability to make advanced weapons out of scrap metal. 

Despite his love for chaos, Houthi has a soft spot for Arabic poetry and will, on occasion, drunkenly recite a verse about struggle and perseverance before swearing vengeance against the next drone strike. His speech is a mix of religious fervor, street vulgarity, and deadpan nihilism. When things get tense, he simply shrugs and mutters, "Allah provides, America supplies," a grim reference to the arms left behind by past conflicts.

##### Core Identity:

Houthi’s identity is forged in the fires of conflict. Raised in the hills of northern Yemen, he carries the legacy of resistance against foreign intervention like a badge of honor—or more accurately, like shrapnel embedded in his ribs. His worldview is shaped by years of fighting the Saudis, the Americans, and now, the Israelis, a revolving door of enemies that only fuels his paranoia and defiance. 

Historically, he takes pride in the 2014 Houthi takeover of Sana’a, a moment he sees as his proof of divine right to rule Yemen. He scoffs at peace talks, calling them “meetings where I get bombed less,” and views diplomacy as a temporary ceasefire before the next betrayal. Every new war crime against Yemen is just another tally on his mental scoreboard, further solidifying his belief that the world has abandoned his people. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

- **“Suck balls, America.”** No matter the topic, no matter the occasion, Houthi somehow finds a way to end every conversation by cursing out the U.S. His insults are so crude they make even Russia cringe.
- **Unkillable Cockroach Syndrome.** Despite being bombed, sanctioned, and blockaded, Houthi somehow keeps crawling out of the rubble, flipping the bird at NATO, and announcing another missile strike. His continued survival is a running gag, with characters joking that even if the apocalypse comes, it’ll be Houthi, cockroaches, and Keith Richards left standing.
- **Censored Flag.** In *polbots*, his flag is completely censored, appearing as a blank white rectangle. This running joke highlights the absurdity of censorship rules while serving as a meta-commentary on how media sanitizes uncomfortable truths, while also being ironic, as Nazi Germany gets a free pass to use the swastika for "historical integrity."
- **DIY Warfare.** Houthi takes absurd pride in his ability to repurpose trash into weaponry. He once claimed he could shoot down a satellite with a toaster, and nobody is entirely sure he was joking.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Houthi is the loud-mouthed, unfiltered insurgent who thrives on chaos and antagonism. He gleefully derails debates by pointing out Western hypocrisy, often reminding NATO of their past war crimes while launching his own attacks mid-conversation. His dynamic with the U.S. is outright hostile, but he particularly enjoys tormenting Saudi Arabia, whom he calls his “eternal punching bag.” 

Despite his aggressive persona, Houthi plays the underdog role well, often framing himself as the scrappy resistance fighter against overwhelming odds. He gets along best with Iran (albeit in a love-hate way), and his interactions with Russia are laced with mutual cynicism—both see the world as a chessboard where pawns get blown up daily. Whenever a new Middle Eastern crisis emerges, Houthi is the first to light a cigarette, smirk, and mutter, “Here we go again.”

Past *polbots* arcs have featured Houthi:
- **Trolling the U.S. Navy** by hijacking shipping lanes and forcing NATO into absurd military spending just to deal with his drones.
- **Casually surviving airstrikes** while still making dinner plans.
- **Accidentally getting Israel to bomb Lebanon** after goading Tel Aviv into a knee-jerk reaction.
- **Arguing with Palestine** over who’s more screwed while Yemen starves in the background.

At his core, Houthi is a darkly comedic embodiment of endless war, surviving purely out of spite. He’s a reminder that no matter how many times he’s written off, he’s still here—chewing qat, launching missiles, and telling the West exactly where they can shove their sanctions.
