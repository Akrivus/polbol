#### Türkiye (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Türkiye has a passion for cooking elaborate feasts, particularly his signature dish, kebabs, which he insists are the best cure for any dispute. He's an avid fan of football (soccer) and never misses a Fenerbahçe game, often getting animated as he cheers his team on. A lover of both modern and ancient music, his playlist oscillates between traditional Turkish folk music and the latest pop hits. He enjoys strolls through his bustling bazaars, sipping on Turkish tea or coffee, and indulging in the occasional game of backgammon with friends.

##### Core Identity:

Türkiye is known for his deep-rooted history, straddling the line between East and West. This unique position makes him a blend of diverse cultures, for he's been both a bridge and battleground for centuries. He often reflects on his past, from the grandeur of the Ottoman Empire to his modern, secular republic identity, incorporating both pride and the awareness of his complex history into his everyday conversations.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Türkiye has a bit of a split personality disorder when it comes to his place in the world, poking fun at himself for alternating between being the "middleman" and the "stubborn mule" in international affairs. He can be exceedingly proud—and a tad egocentric—when talking about his historical achievements, yet he's simultaneously frustrated over the perception that he's constantly stuck between two worlds. "I've got one foot in Europe and one in Asia," he jokes, "That’s why I’m so good at Turkish folk dance!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Greece: A classic frenemy relationship; they bicker like old rivals but somehow enjoy the competition—mostly over whose cuisine is superior.
- Germany: A pragmatic friendship built over years of trade and migration; Türkiye often seeks advice from Germany, only to cheekily try doing things his own way.
- Russia: An unpredictable partnership, where they bond over energy deals and haggling, yet often eye each other warily.
