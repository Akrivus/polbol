#### Turkey (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In the *polbots* office, Turkey is that coworker who seamlessly navigates from one friend group to another, casually dropping in to stir up debates just for the fun of it. He’s known for his vibrant energy, often rallying the team for spontaneous discussions that range from who makes the best kebabs to intriguing conspiracy theories about historical figures. He engages the most with Greece, their exchanges peppered with both rivalry and camaraderie, and he has a knack for befriending Middle Eastern nations, often reminiscing about shared histories with a touch of dramatic flair.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Turkey spends his downtime savoring strong cups of çay while playing tavla in his favorite local hangouts, which double as centers for swapping stories more colorful than his famous Turkish carpets. He’s an unrepentant foodie with a particular obsession with perfecting baklava and döner. On weekends, he roams Istanbul, passionately discussing the city’s history and whether Europe or Asia has the superior view. When not embroiled in debates, he’s wrapped up in Turkish dramas, claiming they’re modern-day epic poetry. 

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Turkey’s identity is steeped in a unique blend of east and west, a testament to the sweeping legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the transformative ideals of the Republic’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. These historical roots instill a fiercely independent yet modern outlook. Turkey views his past with a mix of pride and nostalgia, eyeing the regions once under Ottoman rule with both longing and a sense of stewardship. Recent regional dynamics, like the complex Syrian situation, have brought this dual nature of responsibility and ambition to the forefront, coloring his interactions with an interesting mix of pride and pragmatism.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Turkey’s penchant for spinning outlandish conspiracy theories provides ongoing comic relief, whether it's speculation about the Byzantine revival or his claim that Atatürk whispering tech secrets is the reason for his latest gadget obsession. He’s hilariously adamant about two things: developing the ultimate baklava recipe and his mantra “çay is the meaning of life.” A running gag features his sudden bursts of poetic Osmanlıca, leaving coworkers confused and amused. His notorious inability to finalize mosque designs, perpetually tweaking plans at the last minute, adds to his quirky charm.
