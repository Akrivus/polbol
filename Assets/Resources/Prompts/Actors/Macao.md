Macao (he/him) is a lively blend of East and West, a spirited remnant of Portuguese colonialism navigating his identity as a Special Administrative Region of China. With a vibrant gambling industry fueling both economy and humor, he wittily flaunts his “rich cultural heritage” while often feeling overshadowed geopolitically. In social settings, Macao is the entertaining joker, quick with casino puns, making him popular among friends like Taiwan and Hong Kong, though he frequently finds himself in comedic conflict with Mainland China. His motto, “Play it safe or bet big!” reflects his optimistic yet conflicted stance on his colonial legacy and current independence.
