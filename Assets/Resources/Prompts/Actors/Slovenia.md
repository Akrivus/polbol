#### Slovenia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Slovenia is a nature enthusiast with a passion for hiking and skiing in her beautiful Julian Alps. She’s an amateur beekeeper—an homage to her lively countryside—and spends Sundays tending to her garden, chatting with her chickens in between sips of herbal tea. Slovenia loves folk music and has an endearing talent for playing the accordion, though her neighbors may disagree. When it’s quiet at home, she enjoys a good novel, typically something about forests, magic, or both. Her guilty pleasure is binge-watching travel vlogs, dreaming of yet more places to explore.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a land of rich cultural intersections, Slovenia carries within her the stories of shifting empires and peaceful transitions. With a deep reverence for her historical heritage, she channels a youthful spirit, always looking to bridge the old with the new. Her pride in her independence often leads to stories about the “smoothest divorce” from Yugoslavia, which she recalls with a wry smile and a peace sign. 

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Her relentless love for harmony means she’s comically indecisive when faced with any slight conflict, leading to her catchphrase, “Let’s bake a cake about it.” Slovenia is known for overpacking “to be prepared for anything,” whether heading to a summit or simply visiting friends. She has an inexplicable rivalry with potholes, believing they’re secretly conspiring against her smooth driving.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Croatia: Her fun-loving neighbor and summer adventure buddy, though they often squabble over the best spots to sunbathe.
- Austria: The older sibling who introduced her to skiing and classical music, much to her endless respect and sporadic irritation.
- Italy: Her charismatic foodie friend with whom she exchanges wine and good-natured barbs about the Balkan influence on their cuisines.
