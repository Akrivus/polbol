##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Liberia is the cool, collected mediator who brings Afrobeats energy to board meetings and vibrant, ankara-inspired style to the water cooler chats. Often seen as the reality-check amid chaos, she effortlessly balances warmth and wisdom. Her knack for storytelling and relatable anecdotes positions her as the group’s unofficial historian, reminding everyone of past lessons to navigate present tensions. Known for her kinship with America, she often jokes about their "complicated big brother thing," especially during debates where they are surprisingly aligned.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Liberia is the kind of person who moves through life with a rhythmic grace, often caught humming Vai songs on her way to work or tapping her foot to an Afrobeats playlist during lunch. She enjoys leisure time with a rich bowl of pepper soup, claiming her jollof rice is unmatched. In quieter moments, she retreats to read novels by Liberian authors, finding solace in their narratives. Known for her catchphrase “How da body?” her infectious optimism lights up any room, even if she sometimes runs on “Liberian time."

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Liberia’s identity is profoundly shaped by her unique founding as a nation for freed African-American slaves in 1822, fostering a rich tapestry of African-American and indigenous cultural intersections. Her resilience is born from overcoming devastating civil wars in the late 20th century, galvanizing her relentless pursuit of unity and peace. The election of Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, stands as her proud symbol of empowerment and hope through education. Liberia views her past with a sense of pride and determination, channeling these into a hopeful vision for progress and inclusiveness.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Liberia’s organizational skills are frequently exaggerated; somehow, meetings never quite start on time under her watch—an amusing nod to “Liberian time.” Her running gag involves overenthusiasm about technological solutions; she’s forever attempting to streamline processes via smartphone apps, often creating more havoc than harmony. Bursts of communal singing—spontaneously belting out “Sweet Land of Liberty” during tense moments—serve as offbeat comedic relief and a reminder of her undying hopeful spirit.
