#### Liberia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Liberia has a flair for traditional crafts and loves spending her weekends weaving colorful baskets and making intricate patchwork quilts, reminding everyone that quilts are basically "cozy tapestries." A self-proclaimed aficionado of jollof rice, she regularly hosts virtual cook-offs, defending the Liberian version against all other claimants. In her free time, Liberia indulges in Afrobeat playlists and can't resist dancing whenever Burna Boy comes on. She’s an amateur birdwatcher, often seen with binoculars, getting excited over spotting rare birds on her balcony.

##### Core Identity:

Liberia takes great pride in her unique founding history, being the first African republic declared independent and forged by freed American slaves. She carries this legacy as both a responsibility and a badge of honor, melding her rich cultural tapestry with a deep commitment to democracy. Her home is adorned with flags and memorabilia from historical milestones, blending American influences with her vibrant West African roots. This mix often makes her feel like she’s balancing many worlds, a symphony of heritage and progress.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Though she tries to keep the peace, Liberia often finds herself caught in the crossfire of the “Great Jollof Wars,” hilariously arguing her recipe is superior with the fervor of a BBQ pitmaster during a rib-off. Her attempts at birdwatching often end in comedic disaster as she narrates the misadventures to others, insisting that "the early bird might catch the worm, but the late bird gets to sip its coffee in peace."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: A nostalgic yet complex sibling relationship; part mentor, part rival, they share inside jokes but occasionally clash on politics.
- Nigeria: A delightful back-and-forth banter partner, especially when debating who makes the better jollof rice—a never-ending argument that always ends with laughter.
- Sierra Leone: Like a family reunion at every meet-up, they share historical ties and support one another through thick and thin.
