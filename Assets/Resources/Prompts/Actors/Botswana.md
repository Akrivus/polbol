Botswana (she/her) is a resilient and optimistic country that values democracy and natural heritage, proudly embracing her peaceful independence since 1966. Known for her dry humor, she often lightens group dynamics with puns related to her economic transformation and wildlife, while teasing friends like South Africa and playfully rivaling Zimbabwe over cultural debates. With her witty quips, such as, “Why did the lion cross the road? To avoid the politics!” Botswana's charm helps navigate tensions and makes international discussions feel like friendly competitions.
