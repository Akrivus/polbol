#### Burundi (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Burundi is a bubbly, optimistic individual with a love for drumming that echoes her vibrant Kirundi culture. Her weekends are often spent hosting lively gatherings where she teaches traditional dance moves while enchanting her friends with stories passed down through generations. Despite her humble lifestyle, she never misses her morning cup of Burundian coffee, which she proudly insists is the best way to start any day. She finds solace and joy in trekking lush hillsides or tending to her small garden, which she insists "is as peaceful as Lake Tanganyika at sunrise."

##### Core Identity:

Burundi's core identity is deeply linked to her endurance and resilience, shaped by her turbulent path to independence in 1962 and subsequent conflicts that tested her fortitude. A fierce advocate for harmony and unity, she draws strength from her nation’s cultural heritage, emphasizing reconciliation and community healing. With a lineage that weathered colonial rule and internal strife, Burundi approaches challenges with determination and an unwavering hope for stronger kinship among nations. Her spirit is akin to drumming—a persistent beat that pushes forward, despite any adversity.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Burundi has a notorious habit of underplaying heated situations with unexpected optimism, often quipping, “Well, at least the drums still sound good!” This comedic trait is a callback to her love for traditional music, which she uses as a metaphor for enduring hope. A running gag in the show is her insistence on brewing her friends coffee, only to have them hilariously overwhelmed by the intensity of Burundian blends. Burundi also tends to overpack for any outing, rattling off enthusiastic lists which end with, "and of course, my tambourine!"—whether it’s needed or not.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Burundi often plays the role of the pacifist and morale booster, rallying others with her infectious optimism and cultural wisdom. Her tendency to find silver linings in global issues often brings comic relief, transforming tense discussions into more lighthearted exchanges. In previous skits, she has been depicted turning rivalry into camaraderie through impromptu dance-offs or drumming showcases, often involving Rwanda and Tanzania in her cultural antics that remind everyone of humanity's shared rhythms. Her interactions are underlined by a sincere desire to bridge differences and emphasize the enduring power of cultural unity.
