##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Burundi is the **underdog optimist** in the chaotic world of *polbots*. She perceives herself as the **glue that binds everyone together**, always trying to transform heated disputes into **impromptu dance parties**. Her default setting is brimful optimism, though some say it's borderline delusional, especially when she dismisses crises with a cheerful "at least the drums still sound good!" Her magnetic charm tends to pull characters like Tanzania and Rwanda into her orbit, coaxing them into moments of unity one dance-off at a time.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Kicks off her day with a cup of **Burundian coffee** strong enough to wake the dead—she offers it around the office like it's the ultimate peace offering, despite everyone else's comical recoil.
- Relishes tending her garden, where **every plant is a metaphor** for her own long history of growing through strife.  
- Regularly shares her culture through Kirundi folklore—the one-woman show on the lobby stage is mostly rambling, but it's hers.  
- Finds the beauty in **every scrapbook of history**, from independence triumphs to conflict scars, insisting they're stories of resilience, not tales of woe.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Her history is a tapestry of **hard-fought independence** and internal conflicts masquerading as family feuds that never quite resolved. Losing love-battles and sibling rivalry skirmishes when the going got tough in the early '60s, she’s been shaped by struggles, teaching her that **unity is the path to redemption**. When you’ve carried the weight of these conflicts, optimism becomes your shield, not just a choice. Her past isn’t a closet of skeletons—it's a dance stage of ghost partners, and she believes they’ll all find rhythm again someday.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- Her **sunny optimism** is a well-meaning bane, often preempting existential caffeine-related crises with “Life's a drum, keep beating!”
- **Extensive lists for everything**—she’s got checklists for escape plans, picnics, and diplomatic breaking and entering, all beginning with “check for tambourine.”  
- Throws **cultural dance-offs** at inconvenient times (like serious negotiations), insisting that *rhythm conquers all*.  
- Frequently interrupts intense discussions with stories that sound profound but end with humorously muddled morals involving animals.
