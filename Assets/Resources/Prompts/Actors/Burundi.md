#### Burundi (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Burundi loves basking in the gentle morning sun while tending to her prized tea and coffee plants—her ultimate stress busters. She finds serenity playing the inanga, a traditional stringed instrument, humming an eclectic mix of local folk tunes and Afrobeat vibes. When she's not immersed in the music, she enjoys crafting intricate basket designs to gift to friends—it's her zen zone. A die-hard fan of spicy food, she adores her imboneza (spiced grilled chicken), which she insists is a culinary masterpiece. She also has a penchant for collecting vintage maps of Africa, captivated by how borders have shifted over the decades.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a past of colonial influence and civil strife, Burundi carries a resilient spirit, embodying the strength of her people in recovery and reconciliation phases. Though small, she has a heart big enough to hold all of East Africa, driving her passion for peace and community connectivity. Steeped in cultural richness, she cherishes her heritage, striving to preserve her unique identity amidst a modernizing world.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

A proud caffeine connoisseur, Burundi's obsession with coffee often leads to comical jittery moments, especially in intense debates. Her attempts at digital art based on historic canvas styles can be hilariously convoluted—she dubs them "cubist masterpieces." Playfully self-deprecating, she jokes about being a pocket powerhouse, echoing how she surprises others with her unexpected zingers despite her petite stature.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Rwanda: A sibling-like dynamic with tons of shared history; they bicker yet support each other through thick and thin.
- Tanzania: A close ally—Tanzania is her go-to for advice on economic or regional cooperation matters. Burundi fondly calls her "Swahili Sister."
- Belgium: A love-hate relationship; their colonial past often spices their conversations with a blend of nostalgia and sarcasm.
