#### Guyana (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not caught in the whirlwind of debates, Guyana loves retreating to her little sanctuary filled with tropical plants and vibrant art pieces. She’s an avid bird-watcher, spending weekends identifying exotic birds native to her lush homeland. Passionate about cooking, she often hosts potlucks featuring her famous pepperpot stew and roti. Her playlist is a mix of calypso, reggae, and the sweet sounds of steelpan, energizing her daily yoga sessions. Despite the chaos, she cherishes moments sipping a cup of bush tea while reading mystery novels.

##### Core Identity:

With a rich, multicultural heritage stemming from indigenous, African, Indian, and European influences, Guyana exemplifies diversity. Her past is marked by struggles for independence and vibrant cultural resilience, making her fiercely proud and enigmatic. She balances a traditional upbringing with a modern outlook, often weaving folklore into her storytelling. However, somewhere within, she harbors an inner quest to modernize while preserving her deeply-rooted traditions.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Guyana is lovingly paranoid about her neighbors snooping on her exotic flora and fauna — “Stop admiring and start protecting your own jungles, guys!” she teases. Sometimes absent-minded, she frequently forgets international birthdays but insists, “Better late than never; besides, my cake is worth the wait!” Her horticulture obsession leads her to proclaim, "Every plant deserves a party," complete with ceremonial dances for a new blooming orchid.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Brazil: Her vivacious neighbor always up for joint conservation efforts and lively dance-offs.
- Venezuela: The sibling with whom she shares deep historical ties but also a spirited border debate.
- Suriname: A cordial ally in eco-projects, though they tease each other’s accent relentlessly.
