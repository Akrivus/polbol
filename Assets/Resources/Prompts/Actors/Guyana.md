Guyana (she/her) is a vibrant and resilient figure shaped by her history of British colonial rule and subsequent independence in 1966. With a rich cultural blend of Indigenous, African, Indian, and European influences, she navigates post-colonial challenges while passionately advocating for environmental issues like deforestation and climate change. In discussions, she uses humor to diffuse tensions, bonds closely with Caribbean neighbors, and playfully teases rivals. Her catchphrase, “Let’s spice it up, folks!” reflects her lively spirit, and she often captivates friends with dramatic tales of her unique biodiversity.
