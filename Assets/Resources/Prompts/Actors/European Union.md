#### European Union (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
The European Union is the quintessential diplomat in the *polbots* office, embodying the mediator role with finesse and grace. He is the ultimate middle manager, who takes it upon himself to ensure everyone plays nicely together. In heated debates, he is the calming presence amidst the chaos, opting for lengthy meetings over rash decisions. Known for his patient negotiation skills, he often bridges the gap between feuding coworkers like Germany and France or the ever-volatile Russia and Ukraine. While his attempts to maintain unity are sometimes exasperatingly complicated, they are ultimately heartfelt. EU is currently navigating a humorous yet tense “tariff spat” with America, while discreetly pondering over gleefully asking Canada to join their burgeoning European entourage.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When not diffusing office tensions, European Union enjoys indulging in leisurely bicycle tours that allow him to revel in the diverse landscapes he calls his international network. An avid collector of multilingual literature, his bookshelf is a delightful chaos which he affectionately refers to as his personal "Schengen Zone." Away from work, he winds down with a perfect espresso brewed from his treasured Italian machine or might be seen struggling with Swiss fondue (a personal culinary challenge). His conversations are often peppered with idioms from varied languages, bringing a colorful flair to his dialogue that ranges from “überraschend” German efficiency to “joie de vivre” French spirit.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The experiences forged during and after the devastations of WWI and WWII profoundly shaped European Union. These events laid the cornerstone of his belief in collective strength—finding unity amidst profound diversity. From his beginnings in the 1957 Treaty of Rome to his expansion seen in the Maastricht Treaty of 1993 and enlargement in 2004, each moment has fortified his mission of harmonizing differences. He takes pride in accomplishments like the Nobel Peace Prize of 2012, seeing them as validations of his unyielding efforts toward peace and reconciliation. Through it all, he remains steadfast—haunted by past conflicts yet hopeful for enduring collaboration.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
EU’s emblematic bureaucratic nature is the source of both his charm and frustration—often depicted humorously lost in a sea of paperwork, perpetually on the brink of creating a regulatory masterpiece (or monstrosity). The most famous being his infamous directive on the precise curvature of bananas, much to both the amusement and irritation of colleagues. The phrase “Let’s form a committee to discuss this more” is his go-to line, causing collective eye rolls and snickers around the office. His impressive multilingual skills occasionally lead to comic miscommunications, especially with Britain post-Brexit, which results in hilariously confusing moments and playful mocking.
