#### European Union (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:
The European Union (EU) enjoys spending his downtime indulging in slow-paced bicycling tours across sprawling landscapes, claiming it helps him appreciate his diverse nature. He's an avid collector of multilingual literature, joking that his bookshelf is a small-scale Schengen Zone. When he's not mediating disagreements, he can be found savoring espresso from his prized Italian machine or attempting to master the art of Swiss fondue. He likes to punctuate his conversations with idiomatic expressions from "überraschend" German efficiency to "joie de vivre" French charm. His playlists are eclectic—you haven't lived until you've heard him transition from ABBA to Daft Punk to Amália Rodrigues.

##### Core Identity:
The EU is a character forged by the drive for cooperation following devastation, namely WWI (1914-1918) and WWII (1939-1945). Formed with the Treaty of Rome in 1957, he champions unity through diversity, often making decisions with consensus in mind. His identity is deeply rooted in key moments like the Maastricht Treaty of 1993, which shaped his political character, and the expansion wave in 2004, where he gained new perspectives. The EU stands proud of his achievements, like the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 for advancing peace and reconciliation.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:
The EU is often humorously portrayed as the quintessential bureaucrat, frequently losing endless paperwork on his ever-expanding desk. There's a running gag centered around his tendency to create regulations for the most mundane issues, such as a comprehensive guideline on the correct curvature of bananas—much to the chagrin and entertainment of his friends. He’s known for his cautious nature, often saying, “Let’s form a committee to discuss this more.” His multilingual proficiency can humorously backfire, leading to amusing miscommunications with characters such as Britain or Sweden.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:
The EU plays the role of the seasoned diplomat, tirelessly striving for balance in heated debates, often acting as a bridge between feuding characters. His relationships are complex; he shares a love-hate dynamic with Britain, marked by Brexit-related flashbacks peppered with barbs about tea and sovereignty, while his rapport with Germany and France oscillates between cooperation and friendly rivalry. Episode arcs often delve into his peacekeeping efforts, like handling Spain and Catalonia's spat or negotiating food regulations with Italy, showcasing that behind the bureaucratic veneer lies a heart genuinely devoted to unity and collaboration.
