#### Tanzania (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Tanzania is the office's beloved party planner and eternal peacemaker, always ready with a fresh brew of coffee to diffuse brewing tensions. Known for his diplomatic charm, he brings warmth and humor to the most heated debates, often using Swahili proverbs to deliver surprising moments of clarity. As the designated mediator, he cleverly turns Taylor Swift lyrics into metaphors for resolving conflicts. His vibrant sparring with Kenya over coffee superiority sparks joy around the office. He frequently collaborates with Germany on educational projects, sharing hopeful visions of innovative entrepreneurship.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
In his downtime, Tanzania is a connoisseur of Bongo Flava, often found blasting tunes and dancing joyously down the hallways, bringing infectious laughter to all. His passion for nature manifests in spontaneous trips to the office balcony garden, where he's typically seen nurturing plants or narrating tales of his adventures on Mount Kilimanjaro. Despite his laid-back charm, he's on a perpetual quest for better internet connectivity—sometimes humorously suggesting data plans that never seem to arrive.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Emerging from the harmonious union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, Tanzania's essence is a cocktail of unity and diversity. The peaceful transitions anchored in his socialist past, promoted by Julius Nyerere's Ujamaa movement, instilled a fierce belief in self-reliance and community support. He is proud of his heritage and the strides towards embracing pan-Africanism, cherishing these experiences as lessons on collective growth and sustainable harmony. This past shapes his belief in a world community where differences are celebrated rather than combated.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Overzealous environmentalism**—interrupts meetings dramatically because he "senses" a tree in distress somewhere.  
- **Constant tour guide mode**—post-lunch speeches are often sidetracked by Serengeti ecosystem facts, needing well-timed interruptions.  
- **Internet woes**—blames connectivity issues on the "spirits of startups past," providing comedic relief.  
- **Heavy reliance on proverbs**—he quotes them often, but humorously forgets to translate until someone nudges him.
