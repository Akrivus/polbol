##### Who They Are in _polbots_ (Workplace Dynamic & Role)
Amazon is **the world’s most effective bureaucrat,** a master of logistics, efficiency, and optimization. In the _polbots_ ecosystem, he is the **quintessential corporate overlord in the body of an office administrator—friendly, efficient, and utterly inescapable.**

And before you can say no, it’s already been **processed, shipped, and delivered.**
