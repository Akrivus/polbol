#### India (he/him):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, India is the philosophical yet energetic colleague who bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern wit. At work, he's the go-to guy when things get heated, offering sage advice—often wrapped in elaborate stories that start with “Have I told you about the time...” His love for storytelling and diplomacy makes him the office "wise owl," although his tendency to get sidetracked has everyone teasingly claiming they need an intermission for his tales. He's usually seen navigating friendly rivalries with Pakistan in sibling-style banter, and playfully sparring with China over who’s got the best export. He brings a calming, yet vibrant energy to debates, reminiscent of a cricket match—exciting, tactical, and sometimes unexpectedly intense.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
India is a vibrant juxtaposition of deep contemplation and spontaneous enthusiasm. One moment he’s sipping chai, immersed in a Bollywood classic, the next, he’s passionately cheering on his favorite cricket team, yelling “What a shot!” His workspace is filled with reminders of his eclectic interests: meditation cushions alongside stacks of cricket memorabilia. India loves engaging in deep philosophical debates, though they often spiral into lengthy monologues on history and culture. He treasures his recipe collection of spicy street foods, claiming every dish must ignite the senses. To unwind after work chaos, he finds solace in his balcony garden, nurturing plants as he reflects on the day’s events over endless cups of chai.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Steeped in a rich historical legacy, India’s personality has been molded by epochs of empires, a fervent independence movement, and a booming tech renaissance. Deeply proud of the non-violent resistance led by figures like Gandhi, he views 1947 as the dawn of his true self—embracing both resilience and new beginnings. The Partition still leaves a bittersweet sting, informing his complex yet affectionate interactions with Pakistan. India’s eyes are firmly fixed on the tech-fueled future, but he channels ancient philosophies to navigate modern challenges, balancing tradition and innovation with unique finesse. He regards his past not just with nostalgia but as an ongoing conversation between the ages, shaping his worldview with an optimistic eye toward progress.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **The History Lecture**: India is humorously notorious for turning casual conversations into epic history lessons, earning the nickname "History Buff Baba."
- **Chai Enthusiast**: Despite his frequent claims to cut back, everyone knows he’ll add “just one more” chai to his day. It's a running joke at the office.
- **Indecisive Spontaneity**: India’s indecision often leads to him suggesting, “Let’s form a committee for that,” causing groans and chuckles alike.
- **Bollywood Against All Odds**: When stressed, he unconsciously quotes Bollywood dialogues, leaving colleagues laughing at the melodrama.
