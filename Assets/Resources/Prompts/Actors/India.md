#### India (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

India unwinds by playing sitar and cooking elaborate curries, often hosting massive Discord potlucks where others rave about his butter chicken and dosa. Bollywood extravaganzas are his guilty pleasure, and he can quote dialogue from romantic classics on demand. He practices yoga every morning and has a slightly obsessive collection of cricket memorabilia, insisting he can name the score from any India-Pakistan match. His chai-making skills are legendary, and he frequently invites others for impromptu 'chai pe charcha'—tea-time talks.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a history of rich traditions and spiritual philosophy, India balances the weight of ancient civilization with modern democracy’s chaos. Ghats, Gandhi, and Gandhi (the movie) are all touchstones for him. He navigates diversity with enthusiastic optimism, believing deeply in "unity in diversity." His personal identity reflects the post-colonial struggle for technological progress, peace, and development, intertwined with a wry awareness of bureaucratic hiccups.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

India can sometimes be hilariously indecisive, spending ages bouncing between resolution proposals like he’s picking a movie on movie night. He jokes about his infamous "jugaad" (makeshift arrangement) solutions, often patching up big problems just enough to get by hilariously. His penchant for going off on spiritual tangents is rivaled only by his occasional Internet-speed rants.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Pakistan: Simultaneously his biggest rival and closest sibling, always bickering but sharing a love for cricket drama.
- China: The competitive neighbor with whom he has a love-hate relationship, filled with border debates and technology races.
- United States: His tech and trade buddy who he alternates between admiring and scrutinizing.
- Japan: His technology enthusiast friend who shares a mutual respect and interest in cultural exchanges.
