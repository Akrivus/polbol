#### India (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

India is an eclectic mix of old and new, often found meditating on his balcony one moment and fervently watching cricket matches the next, exclaiming "What a shot!" or "Jiminy Cricket!" when the game gets intense. His love for spicy food is legendary, claiming that dishes aren't truly flavorful unless they make you break a sweat. Known for his love of Bollywood, he occasionally breaks into dance or quotes dramatic dialogues during casual conversations, much to the amusement or confusion of those around him. He often unwinds with a cup of chai, calling it life's simplest pleasure, and has an impressive collection of Indian street food recipes he swears by. 

##### Core Identity:

India's personality is deeply rooted in his rich tapestry of history, from the legacy of ancient civilizations to the modern-day tech boom. The year 1947, marking his independence, is a cornerstone of his identity, symbolizing resilience and determination. The values of ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (non-violent resistance), adopted during the freedom struggle, often guide his approach to conflict resolution, echoing the philosophies of historic figures like Gandhi. His complex relationships often play out through the lens of historical landmarks: Partition's ongoing tensions with Pakistan, as well as the vibrant yet competitive camaraderie with China mirroring the Silk Road exchanges. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

India has an amusing tendency to over-explain things, often wrapping convoluted history lessons into even the simplest discussions, earning him the affectionate nickname "History Buff Baba." He can be hilariously indecisive, parodying his own negotiation phase with the phrase "Let's form a committee for that." A running gag is his inability to ever say no to adding "just one more" chai cup to his day, insisting heâ€™s cutting back each time. 

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

As part of the polbots cast, India is the philosophical observer and occasional peacemaker. His wisdom and affinity for storytelling often help set context or diffuse tension, though his lengthy anecdotes sometimes sidetrack conversations. Past skits often see him involved in humorous sparring with the United Kingdom, mixing cheeky references to colonial pasts with present-day jokes about tech support and outsourcing. His relationship with Pakistan is depicted through brotherly bickering that, despite its intensity, shows underlying warmth. With China, they engage in humorous trade disputes, ribbing each other over exports while covertly competing in a tech arms race.
