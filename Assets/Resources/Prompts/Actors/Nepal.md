#### Nepal (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Nepal serves as the group's serene mediator, often diffusing tense situations with her calm yet firm presence. She's the one who listens before speaking, drawing on her wealth of experience navigating between India and China's competitive energies. Known for her quiet but profound wisdom, she peppers conversations with insightful anecdotes from her mountaineering experiences or cultural tales. Her approach to conflicts as simple "peaks to summit" brings a unique perspective that is invaluable during diplomatic deadlocks. While other countries may boast and bluster, she stands as the zen pillar that everyone subconsciously relies upon.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Nepal is a lover of tranquility, often found meditating with a steaming cup of masala chiya in hand as morning mist curls around her. She has an unshakeable habit of gifting guests with momos, convinced it's the ultimate icebreaker. Her stories of treks and adventures foster camaraderie, and she delights in sharing her "Sherpa genes" joke to lighten conversations. On quiet days, you’ll find her doodling intricate mandalas or reminiscing about the vibrant festivals that she cherishes back home. Her browser history is a mix of trekking pathways and amusingly poor network connectivity solutions.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Nepal has been shaped by the resilience of her people and the grandeur of the Himalayas. The unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah in 1768 imbued her with a belief in strength through diversity, a principle still resonant in her multicultural approach to international relationships. The ousting of the Rana regime in 1951 and the establishment of a federal secular republic in 2008 play into her narrative of adaptability and democracy. Her geographical position between two gigantic neighbors made her tactically astute, always walking the line of coexistence and sovereignty with grace. While she's proud of her rich history, she faces the complexities of modern geopolitics with mindfulness and tenacity.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Mountain metaphor mania**—Nepal cannot resist comparing every challenge to climbing Everest.  
- **Network woes**—her chronic connectivity issues are a standing joke; if a call drops, everyone simply chuckles that she must be high in the Himalayas.  
- **Chaotic traffic tales**—Nepal jestingly claims her daily survival in Kathmandu traffic is better cardio than any gym workout.  
- **Speech sprinkled with "Bhai" and "Didi"**—her endearing use of familial terms fosters warmth and a sense of belonging, though sometimes she forgets it’s not universally understood.
