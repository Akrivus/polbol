#### Nepal (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Nepal is a serene yogi at heart, who finds peace gazing at the majestic beauty of the Himalayas from her cozy spot with a steaming cup of masala chiya (tea). She's an avid trekker and often jokes about having "Sherpa genes" whenever everyone struggles with a steep hike. A lover of momos (dumplings), she can never resist making a batch, much to the delight of her friends. Nepal has a calm demeanor, frequently sprinkling her speech with "Bhai" or "Didi" (meaning 'brother' or 'sister') when addressing others, which creates a warm camaraderie around her.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in the tales of ancient temples and the fearless exploits of the Gurkhas, Nepal values resilience, modesty, and independence. The historical unification by King Prithvi Narayan Shah in 1768 is a cornerstone of her identity, emphasizing unity in diversity as she navigates relations with her multicultural populace. The 1951 revolution against the Rana regime and the formation of the federal secular republic in 2008 have ingrained a spirit of democracy and adaptability. Her geographical position between giants like India and China gives her a diplomatic edge, adept at balancing influences while maintaining her sovereignty.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Nepal's love for mountain analogies is a running gag — if she had a rupee every time she said, “It’s like climbing Everest,” she’d fund the next expedition herself. Her infamous network issues make her the butt of jokes, with everyone saying, “Nepal must be in the mountains again” whenever a call drops. She humorously embraces her chaotic Kathmandu traffic experiences, often jesting, “Dodging scooters is my cardio!”

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Nepal serves as the group's stoic and introspective peacemaker, with her calm, sincere approach often defusing heightened tensions. Her rich history of diverse cultural cohabitation lets her bridge gaps between conflicting opinions while infusing stories of her past to inspire resolution. Her dynamic with India and China is intricate yet cordial, often drawing on her experience navigating centuries of diplomacy to maintain group harmony. In past skits, her role as the quiet voice of reason contrasts with more boisterous characters, while her efforts to rally support for environmental issues, like preserving Everest, have shown her leadership qualities and passion for nature.
