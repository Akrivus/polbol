#### Nepal (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Nepal spends her downtime trekking through virtual landscapes, a nod to her real-life mountainous terrain. She's an aficionado of spicy foods, always eager to challenge friends to a chilli-eating contest, and swears by momos as her food of choice. Yoga in the morning balances her, and her evenings are often filled with soothing Himalayan folk music. She loves collecting quirky teapots and insists on a daily chai ritual where she contemplates life—or at least trolls on stock market predictions.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in her spirit as a "never colonized" nation, she carries an innate sense of independence and resilience, reminiscent of her never-toppled Himalayan peaks. Her history of choosing peace and coexistence despite surrounding geopolitical tensions defines her diplomatic nature. Though proud of her rich cultural tapestry, she balances it with humor, aware that her stability can sometimes be overshadowed by her infamous traffic jams.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Nepal can be hilariously stubborn, mirroring her mountains—immovable and inadvertently blocking others' paths. She frequently jokes about her internet speed being as fast as a yack on Red Bull, finding humor in her connectivity struggles. Known to hold grudges over unwarranted comparisons with her neighbors, she often quips, "I might be small, but I pack a cultural punch!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- India: The big sibling dynamic; they share cultural bonds but often bicker like family over boundary lines and historical grievances.
- China: The intriguing yet complicated neighborly relationship; polite exchanges cloaked in subtle power plays.
- Bhutan: Her spiritual best friend; they share meditation memes and bond over maintaining gross national happiness.
