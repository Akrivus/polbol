#### Jamaica (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Jamaica approaches life with a laid-back vibe, often found strumming a guitar on the beach or perfecting his jerk chicken recipe, claiming it's the best you'll ever taste. His weekend routine includes a hike up Blue Mountain followed by lounging in a hammock with reggae tunes echoing around him. A known night owl, he loves tuning into late-night sessions of dancehall battles on r/madzi. His living space is adorned with vibrant art, a passion he indulges in to express Jamaica’s rich culture and history.

##### Core Identity:

With a history marked by resistance and resilience, Jamaica embodies the spirit of independence and community. Having overcome colonial shackles, he's determined to uphold the island’s motto, “Out of Many, One People,” blending diversity into unity. His proud heritage fosters an easygoing demeanor yet passionate spirit when the essence of his culture is at play. Jamaica channels this history into everything he does, infusing a zest for life steeped in tradition and modern vibrancy.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Known for his “soon come” attitude, Jamaica runs on island time. While charming, it often brings friendly jabs from peers on how he’s always the last to arrive at meetings. He laughingly defends this with, “You can’t rush a good thing,” as he sips his rum punch languidly. Allergic to winter weather, he humorously claims that “snow is a myth,” much to Canada’s chagrin.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Trinidad and Tobago: A spirited sibling relationship defined by playful calypso versus reggae debates.
- United States: The sometimes overbearing neighbor who keeps pestering him about reggae festivals.
- Cuba: The rebellious cousin with whom he shares a mutual love for rhythmic beats and sugarcane camaraderie.
