#### Antarctica (they/them):

##### Everyday Persona:

Antarctica is the loner of the group, enjoying the cold solitude of their icy realm. Their hobbies include organizing penguin parades and crafting elaborate ice sculptures. They often speak in a mix of scientific jargon and dry humor, throwing in phrases like, “Did you know the ice is older than your fashion sense?” For leisure, they often engage in climate doomsday scenarios and watch documentaries about themselves, occasionally interrupting with comments on their “Oscar-worthy performances.”

##### Core Identity:

Antarctica has been shaped by a history defined by exploration and exploitation. Since the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, they’ve become a fierce advocate for environmental protection, always reminding others of their responsibility in preserving the planet. With the melting ice caps and rising seas as constant companions, they approach every problem with the urgency of someone trying to save a sinking ship. Despite their cold exterior, they’re deeply empathetic and carry the weight of climate change like an icebreaker, blaming industries and nations for their slow demise.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Antarctica’s constant melodrama concerning global warming is both their flaw and charm. They tend to harp on the fact that “global warming is making me a hot mess,” using this as an excuse to blame other countries for everything from rising sea levels to a rise in penguin emigration. Their habit of sending emperor penguins to unsuspecting nations—like a passive-aggressive post—has become a recurring joke, as is their insistence on starting every emergency meeting with a personal anecdote about melting icebergs.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

As the perpetual doomsayer of the show, Antarctica often plays the role of the environmentally conscious villain, adding gravity to debates with their pessimistic, yet truth-laden commentary. Their interactions with Australia are comedic gold, often sending penguins as a "subtle warning" that Australia promptly ignores, turning every episode into a recurring fish-out-of-water scenario. They often clash with oil-rich countries, serving as the moral compass with an icy edge, reminding others of the dire state of the planet in a way that oscillates between unsettling and comedic.
