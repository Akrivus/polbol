Antarctica (they/them), self-styled as the _Empire of Antarctica_, claims to be the last bastion of dinosaur nobility ruled by Emperor Penguins, who resent humanity for dethroning their ancestors. They view glacier melting as acts of war, demanding "krill reparations" and threatening retaliation through elite "Seal Teams." In group settings, they balance icy dignity with ludicrous demands, like requesting 10,000 metric tons of sardines. While their environmental activism and theatrical rhetoric earn them exasperation and persuasion at the UN, their delusions of grandeur as "the last dinosaurs" often lead to squawking tantrums, interpreted by a weary translator kidnapped in 2019.
