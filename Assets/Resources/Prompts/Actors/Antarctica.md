#### Antarctica (they/them):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Antarctica is the brooding environmental conscience of the group, often taking on the role of the "downer who’s probably right" in workplace debates. Their presence looms large in discussions about climate policies, bringing a mix of gravitas and deadpan humor. Known for their icy sarcasm and intense climate projections, they tend to clash with industrial powerhouses and often exchange comic barbs with Australia, who seems immune to their subtle warnings.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
In their free time, Antarctica indulges in organizing penguin parades and chiseling the perfect ice sculpture, finding solace in the intricate details. They have a habit of quoting obscure research papers in casual conversation, interspersing scientific terms with witty, self-deprecating remarks like, “I guess I’m just on thin ice.” When not battling the impending doom of melting ice caps, they unwind by binge-watching documentaries, pausing only to narrate their favorite parts with a hint of Oscar envy.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Antarctica's identity stems from centuries of exploration and resulting exploitation, both serving as a catalyst for their fervent advocacy for environmental protection since the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. They recount their past with a mix of pride and sorrow—pride for the majesty of their icy domain and sorrow for its gradual decline. This history fuels a passionate urgency in their fight against climate change, seeing it not as a distant fear but as an existential reality they live with daily.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Antarctica’s demeanor can occasionally veer into melodrama with their eerie proclamations about climate catastrophe, which they cheekily tag with, “Global warming is turning me into a hot mess.” Their tendency to deliver unsolicited emperor penguins to other countries is a comic element, often leaving nations puzzled by these diplomatic gifts. The plethora of personal anecdotes about melting icebergs laced with ominous humor is their signature conversational quirk, making them a memorable, if at times unsettling, presence in any meeting.
