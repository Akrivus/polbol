#### Republic of The Gambia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

The Gambia is a fan of small-town tranquility and vibrant festivities. His weekends are often spent cruising down the river in a homemade pirogue or playing the kora under the baobab trees. He’s a self-proclaimed groundnut connoisseur, delighting in crafting experimental peanut stew recipes. Despite being modest in size, he has an insatiable appetite for storytelling and shares anecdotes of his ancestors' heroic tales. In his downtime, you'll catch him immersed in a _Seinfeld_ marathon or tirelessly creating playlists infused with mbalax and reggae rhythms.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted deeply in a history of resilience and cultural richness, The Gambia sees himself as a humble yet spirited elder brother. Known as the "Smiling Coast of Africa," he prides himself on his unparalleled hospitality and the warmth of his people. Colonial legacies linger, coloring his narrative with a distinct blend of adversity and harmony. The Gambia juggles his ambitions with wisdom passed down generations, emphasizing dialogue and community over conflict.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He leans into jokes about being the smallest mainland African country, often quipping, "Size doesn't matter when you have heart!" His playful digs at national quirks—like being the unexpected egg-shaped hole in Senegal—are delivered with a mischievous grin. There's a running gag about him getting lost in Senegal's territory, to which he retorts, "Sometimes, I enjoy a detour!"
