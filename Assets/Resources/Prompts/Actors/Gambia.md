#### Gambia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, Gambia is the heartening mediator whose energy is a blend of laid-back charm and humble wisdom. He’s the one who diffuses tension in challenging meetings by organizing peanut-sharing sessions, insisting that “a nutty snack breaks tension, not alliances.” While pacifying hostile debates, his gentle wit and philosophical musings often turn potential disasters into moments for camaraderie. Known for championing the underdogs of the world, he bridges small yet significant voices like Bhutan’s, and he’s often seen nudging the Security Council to “chill” during heated discussions.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Gambia’s daily life revolves around music, cheer, and vivid attire that tells stories. He’s frequently found under his favorite baobab, strumming the kora—a melodic pastime that draws listeners in peace. Even away from the meeting rooms, he indulges in cultivating peanuts and broadcasts brief tutorials on “how to master yassa,” claiming he’s perfected it far beyond his “embracing neighbor.” Wrestling matches, adorned in his lively boubous, are his refuge, reflecting Gambia’s intrinsic, easygoing nature and fondness for community.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Shaped by its geographical embrace along the Gambia River, Gambia’s identity is a tapestry of historical interweaving. The influential departure from British rule in 1965 marked his assertive stand for independence. The Banjul Charter in 1981 fortified his advocacy for human and peoples’ rights, adding depth to his faith in diplomacy. Having risen as the smallest mainland African country, Gambia embodies resilience and resourcefulness, often teachably proud of his stature with the mantra, “We’re small, yes, but our heart is mighty and vast.”

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Possessing a propensity to embellish his anecdotes, Gambia finds joy in reliving his proverbial brushes with the globe’s heavier hitters, his tales charmingly exaggerated. His recurrent quibbles with Senegal stir laughter, especially when boasting superior culinary skills in jest. A running joke is Gambia’s difficulty navigating Banjul, humorously coupled with the jest, “How can you lose someone in a city this small?” These quirks ground his presence in realism, lending humor with good-natured humility.
