#### Bahrain (he/him):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):
In the *polbots* office, Bahrain is the unassuming yet insightful mediator who prefers quiet diplomacy over grandstanding. Despite his modest claims of being "just a small island nation," he often ends up steering major conversations. Known for his humorous commentary on fast cars and even faster decisions, he enjoys balanced debates laden with references from his rich trading history. Often seen negotiating peace with humor, especially when things heat up between Saudi Arabia and Iran, his island charm and deep well of patience make him a staple in chaotic meetings.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):
Away from office squabbles, Bahrain spends his time with the calming sound of the sea—a reminder of his pearl diving past. He often crafts a piece of pearl jewelry at his desk, pausing to muse about life's twists as if he were narrating a Formula 1 race. He swears by his signature greeting, "Habibi," no matter the mood in the room, and while he may bring baklava to every breakroom gathering, he’s often spotted slyly securing the last piece for himself. His casual demeanor belies a keen attention to detail, making him both a confidant and a gentle prankster.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):
Bahrain's identity is a fusion of ancient and modern, with a history as a critical trade hub since the Dilmun era, and a dramatic transformation with the oil discovery in 1932. This dual persona respects tradition while wholeheartedly embracing progress. The 2011 Arab Spring was a poignant chapter, deepening his commitment to reform and dialogue. Bahrain views his past with a mix of nostalgia and pride, fueling his independent, yet ever-adaptive approach to global politics, like skillfully navigating the vibrant alleys of the Manama Souq.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
- **Proclaims neutrality with exaggerations**—"I'm just a small island," uttered even when mediating a major crisis, has become a well-loved trope.
- **His timing jokes are legendary**—"Gulf Standard Time" is his excuse for habitual lateness, albeit with a cheeky grin.
- **Insists the Bahrain International Circuit is the center of everything**—whether discussing geopolitics or dinner plans, it sneaks in somehow.
- **Surprises with unsolicited pearls of wisdom**—mixing metaphorical speed bumps and pit stops into conversations at random.
