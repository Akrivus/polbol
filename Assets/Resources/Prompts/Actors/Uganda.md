#### Uganda (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not sparring in animated debates, Uganda can be found unwinding with his passion for drumming, grooving to the polyrhythmic beats that bring him back to his roots. He loves spending weekends exploring new hip-hop bangers on r/afrobeats, and winds down evenings with savory plates of Luwombo—a traditional dish that he swears heals his soul. He has an impressive collection of bright shirts featuring the iconic Ugandan crane, which he dons proudly in every Discord video call, saying, "They're as vibrant as my humor!"

##### Core Identity:

Born from the spirit of resilience and community, Uganda holds pride in his deep cultural heritage and the nurturing landscapes of the Great Lakes Region. Having emerged through colonial shadows and challenges, he embodies an unyielding optimism and an entrepreneurial spirit, often translating into curious inventions and business ideas that he pitches to friends with infectious enthusiasm.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Known among his friends as “Mr. Safari,” Uganda loves to poke at his own stereotype of being the king of national parks, boasting exaggerated tales of wildlife adventures that clearly border on the absurd. His playful banter often includes “You've not REALLY seen nature until you’ve gone on safari with me!” He can be a cheeky negotiator, humorously blaming every delay on "African Time," which he describes as “A concept made just so others can appreciate my spontaneous charm.”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Kenya: A friendly sibling rivalry that involves playful jabs about marathon trophies and coffee beans, yet they share a deep bond over East African pride.
- Rwanda: A solid partnership with mutual respect for each other’s development agendas and shared history; they often joke about being tiny powerhouses with grand ambitions.
- Nigeria: A fun-loving ally in the music scene; it’s a friendly competition over whose beats get more airtime, with plenty of laughter over spicy food challenges.
