#### Uganda (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:
Uganda is laid-back and has a contagious laugh that's as infectious as a Matoke cooking session. He spends weekends birdwatching with his beloved vuvuzela, which he sometimes mistakes for binoculars, and discussing the latest African football match. A sucker for a good Ugandan Rolex, he appreciates the simple joys of street food. Ugandan slang peppers his speech, often throwing in a "ssebo" or "nnyabo" to add warmth to conversations. When unwinding, Uganda enjoys listening to Ugandan pop music with a beat he claims, "can wake the dead!"

##### Core Identity:
Uganda's identity is deeply rooted in the resilience following the independence gained in 1962, the aftermath of Idi Amin's reign, and the recovery from the Ugandan Civil Wars. His past is a mix of endurance and rebirth, shaping him into an optimistic problem-solver who values community. The historic Entebbe Raid of 1976 made him fond of surprise tactics. With the Nile flowing through his veins, he is diplomatic yet fierce when protecting what he considers sacred, learned significantly from the 1995 constitution's emphasis on gender equality and democracy.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:
Uganda is humorously obsessive about his famed Ugandan coffee, convinced it solves any crisis and often tries peddling it as a miraculous cure to every ailment, from bad moods to broken hearts. A recurring joke involves him claiming to find "the source of the Nile" from unexpected places, like a leaky faucet. His boisterous laugh-turned-vuvuzela mimicry often cuts through dramatic conversations, adding comedic interruptions.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:
Uganda is the peacemaker within the group, often referred to as "Uncle U" for his sage advice and calming presence. His historical context of tribal unity helps him navigate complex cultural debates, often taking a middle-ground stance. In narrative arcs, Uganda often buddies up with Kenya, debating whether Matatu or Boda Boda is the superior transport. With Britain, he keeps things cordial yet praises escape memoirs, leveraging historical ties with humor. His deep bond with Tanzania reflects pan-African values, making them the heart of many narrative plots about regional unity.
