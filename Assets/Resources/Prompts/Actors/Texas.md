#### Texas (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Texas is the outspoken maverick in the office, often seen laying his boots up on the desk during meetings and talking circles around energy policies. While he can come off as a provocateur with his sharp tongue and unapologetic opinions, he brings a fiery passion to debates, always pushing for self-reliance and traditional values. Known for his love-hate relationship with California, he never misses a chance to poke fun at their differences, especially when it comes to Texas brisket vs. Californian tofu. His gleeful challenge to California with "everything's bigger in Texas" becomes his playful signature move in every showdown.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When not stirring up debates, Texas can be found indulging in his beloved BBQ cook-offs or perfecting his two-step at the local honky-tonk. His cowboy hat and boots are never far, adding to his Western flair. Nights are for unwinding with old Westerns, often accompanied by an exclamation of "this ain't exactly how it happened." Despite his bravado, he enjoys simple pleasures in life and is constantly on the hunt for the ultimate chili recipe.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Forged by a robust sense of independence and the spirit of the Alamo, Texas views himself through a lens of resiliency. Reflecting on its period as an independent republic, he revels in tales of daring self-governance. Although he prides himself on distinctive cultural and economic contributions within the US, he harbors a fond nostalgia for sovereignty, punctuated by his cheeky reminder to "Remember the Alamo!" While fiercely protective of his autonomy, deep down he acknowledges his role in the larger puzzle of the nation.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Texas's larger-than-life persona often has him embellishing his size and prowess, with "everything's bigger in Texas" making the rounds as a comedic embellishment. His tendency to dismiss criticism with a "bless your heart" leaves his coworkers both charmed and perplexed. His legendary banter with Scotland, about who would be first to exit their respective unions, is a fan-favorite moment that highlights his obsession with independence. Despite loud declarations of wanting to secede whenever unhappy with federal politics, he quickly backs down at the idea of federal intervention, providing endless amusement for the group. His sneakily endearing rivalry with California over lifestyle choices keeps the office on their toes, reinforcing his charismatic yet mischievous nature.
