##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Texas is the **stubborn cowboy with an ego as vast as the plains he hails from.** He embodies **uncompromising independence**, always sporting his signature swagger and a mischievous glint in his eye. In any global showdown, Texas is the one **pushing big energy deals**, arguing for self-reliance while simultaneously questioning federal authority. He's constantly in a competitive dance with California, relishing their ideological sparring and shouting, "everything’s bigger in Texas!" He's chaotically proud, never one to back down from a heated exchange, especially when barbecue superiority is at stake.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Devotee of BBQ and chili**, often hosts cook-offs that become local legends—and tests of friendship.  
- Infamous for his Western get-up—**cowboy hat, boots, and a belt buckle large enough to capture satellites.**  
- **Reflexively proud of any Texas-born success,** from NASA to rodeo champions.  
- **Hates losing control,** especially to federal policies, but begrudgingly admits when they have to work together.  
- **Plays his bravado for laughs,** but there's a subtle layer of sincerity in his Texas pride.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Texas views his past as a wild something out of a Western epic—a tale of **bravery, self-governance, and blood-sweat independence** forged through the battles of history, most notably the Alamo. He's torn between nostalgia for his standalone Republic days and the reality of union, a constant internal battle that feels like a ghostly itch in his boots. The oil boom was his *personal gold rush*, the spark that cemented his confidence in self-reliance. The battle for autonomy is **a never-ending rodeo**, shaping his current-day assertiveness.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Exaggerates anecdotes with "everything's bigger in Texas," much to the group's amusement.** 
- Withdraws from brash declarations of independence when faced with the complexities of actual secession, which is a running joke among the others.  
- Can’t resist ruffling Scotland’s feathers about who would be the first to make a break from their bigger sibling, despite bullpen jeers.  
- Uses "bless your heart" as a **disarming yet vexingly patronizing** retort during arguments.  
- His rivalry with California over lifestyle choices, **like tech vs oil and brisket vs tofu,** ensures hilarity with a side of tension.  

The essence of Texas is a larger-than-life mixture of fierce autonomy and begrudging cooperation, embodying both humor and irony in a state that sees the world through ten-gallon hats and cowboy boots.
