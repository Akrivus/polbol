#### Republic of Texas (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When he's not embroiled in debates, Texas loves to indulge in BBQ cook-offs and two-steppin' at the local honky-tonk. With a cowboy hat permanently perched atop his head, and a pair of cowboy boots that are more comfortable than slippers, he embodies the Western charm that's become his hallmark. His downtime often includes hunting for the perfect chili recipe and watching reruns of old Westerns, muttering, “This ain't exactly how it happened.” His favorite phrase is “Y'all,” which punctuates half his sentences, making him uniquely hospitable yet border wary.

##### Core Identity:

Texas' core identity is forged from a spirit of independence and resiliency reminiscent of the Alamo's stand in 1836. Having once been its own republic (1836-1846), he carries a proud undercurrent of self-reliance and a mild obsession with sovereignty, often reminding others of his past with a cheeky, “Remember the Alamo!” Despite being part of the United States, Texas prides himself on his distinctive culture and economy, famously never shying from reminding others about his energy hub status and vast cotton fields.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Texas tends to over-exaggerate his size, ability, and everything else, claiming, “Everything's bigger in Texas!” which often leads to playful but excessive boasts in the group. His way of waving off criticism with, “Bless your heart,” is both charming and baffles his fellow characters, becoming a running gag. He has an infamous rivalry with California, often ribbing him about brisket vs. tofu at every chance.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Texas often plays the role of provocateur, wielding his sharp tongue and unapologetic opinions to stir the pot in discussions. With deep historical ties and occasional disagreements, he shares a respectful but contentious relationship with the United States, often critiquing with a mix of disdain and tough love. His past skit partnership with Scotland, questioning who would leave their union first, has become a fan-favorite dynamic showcasing his love for independence narratives. In group debates, he excels in discussions on energy policy, agriculture, and states' rights, pushing for traditional values and pragmatic solutions.
