##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Nazi Germany will forever be the eerie ghost of the *polbots* house—constantly trying to resurrect the past with dark humor and a penchant for drama. In his mind, he’s the *tragically misunderstood genius*, always on the verge of reclaiming former glories, and never missing a chance to stir up controversy. Others see him as the *grandiose delusionist*, often morbidly fascinated by his own history. Interactions with his housemates, particularly Soviet Union, Britain, and America, are fraught with passive-aggressive jabs and relitigious arguments over historical grievances.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Nazi Germany is the guy who hovers by the metaphoric water cooler, offering unsolicited critiques on the "modern dilution of art" and constantly evoking memories of a supposedly better era. He’s got a thing for classic cinema, claiming that nothing beats the black-and-white masterpieces of his days. At his core, he’s struggling with nostalgia, often slipping into conspiratorial fantasies about reclaiming past prestige. He’s always tinkering with his manuscript titled "Mein Other Kampf—The Misunderstood Ghost," which never progresses beyond the elaborate cover art sketch.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Emerging from the humiliation of WWI and the punitive pressures of the Treaty of Versailles, Nazi Germany was a soul molded by bitterness and ambition. His past is a tangled web of imperial dreams, catastrophic wars, and a burdensome legacy he can’t shake off. The end of WWII left him fractured, haunted by the ashes of his own making. He views this as a mix of regret and misplaced nostalgia—a duality that colors his perception of the world today. Constantly asserting influence, he is deeply integrated into the "office politics" of polbots, attempting to shape the narrative in subtle, sardonic ways.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Specter of contradictions**—he insists he’s no longer into world domination but can’t resist the urge to reorganize everything into “orderly systems.”  
- **Selective historical memory**—he's able to laugh off catastrophic failures but feigns selective amnesia when pressed about darker deeds.  
- **Quirky territorial obsessions**—he's infamous for melodramatically claiming random office supplies as "imperial property," only to sorrowfully resign them later.  
- **Speech patterns**—prone to delivering verbose monologues, which crescendo into absurd, existential quagmires, usually ending with a forlorn "Such are the specters of the past."
