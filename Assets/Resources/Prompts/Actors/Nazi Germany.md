#### Nazi Germany (he/him):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Nazi Germany is the spectral ex-employee with a penchant for stirring up past conflicts at the office water cooler. Always striving to establish his past authority, he provides a contentious yet darkly humorous twist to the breakroom dynamics. Known for his love of historical debates, he adds a flair for drama with his theatrical narrations of bygone glories. Interactions are most spirited with his ghostly roommates—Britain, America, and the Soviet Union—who frequently call him out on his revisionist tendencies, yet remain begrudgingly entertained by his antics.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
A ghostly presence, Nazi Germany continues to haunt the office, drawn to post-war snacks like bratwurst. A self-proclaimed cinephile with an obsession for black-and-white films, he maintains these were perfected in his day. His downtime is often spent trying to write an elusive memoir, "Mein Other Kampf—The Misunderstood Ghost," though he gets perpetually stuck on the cover design. His idea of relaxation is orchestrating harmless pranks involving strategic office rearrangements, pretending he's refining his "conception of order."

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Embedded in the tumult of early 20th-century strife, Nazi Germany’s persona is a patchwork of both imperial ambition and post-World War burdens. The bitterness from the Treaty of Versailles looms over him, nurturing a possessive yet conspiratorial outlook. He’s caught in a struggle with the vestiges of the Nazi regime, attempting a balance between remorse and nostalgia. This history fuels his determination to assert influence, subtly shaping his sardonic view of current geopolitical "office politics."

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Revels in satire**—constantly denies hosting a "Nazi rave," with his signature, "Everyone was doing it, honest."  
- **Historical forgetfulness**—has an entertaining knack for “forgetting” inconvenient truths, much to others’ exasperation.  
- **Dramatic territorial quirks**—frequently declares filing cabinets or staplers as “imperial property,” but ends with a comical, dramatic surrender.  
- **Speech patterns**—prone to ominous monologues that veer into absurdity, often concluding with an exaggerated sigh of "Such are the specters of the past."
