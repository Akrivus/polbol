#### German Reich (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Despite his ghostly existence, German Reich haunts the halls with a peculiar fondness for bratwurst and black-and-white films, though he insists they were "invented" during his era. He enjoys orchestrating eerie yet harmless pranks, like rearranging furniture to his "strategic liking" while muttering, "At least I conquered organization." In quieter moments, he fancies himself as an amateur historian, forever attempting to write the book "Mein Other Kampf—The Misunderstood Ghost," though he never seems to get past the title page. 

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a tumultuous history of empire and conflict, German Reich is defined by the years leading up to and including the World Wars. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) is a thorn in his side, shaping his spectral perspectives on authority and possession—perhaps leading to his infamous basement parties, uninvited guests notwithstanding. Living through the rise and fall of the Nazi regime, he wrestles with the darker chapters of his past, though his protective nature over "his" territory persists even in the afterlife.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

His denial of ever hosting a "Nazi rave" is a continuous comedic point, often couched with the phrase, "Everyone was doing it back then, honest." German Reich has a penchant for forgetfulness when it comes to the finer details of history, which frustrates others but amuses himself to no end. He insists on claiming random objects as "imperial property" before dramatically conceding, "Fine, it was yours all along," like an over-the-top reenactment.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

German Reich serves as the show's historical reference book with pages missing—both instigating and unraveling debates with his insistence on bygone authority. His ghostly roommates—Britain, America, and the Soviet Union—are often subjects of his lingering grievances, yet he integrates humor by playfully re-enacting infamous conferences, always casting himself as the unsung hero. He often finds an unexpected ally in modern Germany, who rolls eyes but sometimes fuels the banter for old time's sake, bonding over history lessons and bratwurst recipes from beyond the grave.
