#### German Reich (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not entangled in intense debates, German Reich enjoys an unconventional hobby of collecting model trains, which he races with an eerie dedication. Fond of traditional German cuisine, he often tries recreating historical recipes with a spectral twist—sauerkraut that vanishes if you don't eat it fast enough. Classical music haunts his playlists, with Wagner and Beethoven being his spectral soundtracks. He indulges in Gothic literature, losing himself in the moody ambiance of forgotten days. His presence is never overstated, often felt through a chilly breeze or misplaced lederhosen.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a history of formidable influence and regrettable episodes, German Reich is a ghostly embodiment of the past, striving to acknowledge his history without letting it define him. While he often broods over his tumultuous legacy, he also celebrates the cultural achievements of his homeland with pride. He embodies a juxtaposition of dark humor and profound introspection, continually finding modern lessons in historical contexts.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He tends to romanticize certain periods a bit too nostalgically, reminiscent of a “history reenactor who takes it way too seriously.” Known for occasionally slipping into long-winded orations—“In my day…”—only to trail off upon realizing circumstances have changed… significantly. Despite his occasional self-serious demeanor, he’s quick with a quip about his own spectral presence—"I may not have a throne anymore, but I still know how to make a chilling entrance."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United Kingdom: A love-hate relationship defined by competitive teas and historical ribbing over who managed their empires with more control.
- France: A former rival turned cordial ghostly acquaintance, their interactions are peppered with "Oh là là" and "Ach, du lieber!” exchanges over cultural superiority.
- Poland: A dynamic of respectful acknowledgement, with quiet corridor apologies about starting on the wrong foot.
