#### Kosovo (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When he's not embroiled in discussions about his status or recognition, Kosovo enjoys hiking in the beautiful Balkans and hosting traditional 'kafe' gatherings where Turkish coffee is served strong enough to stand a spoon in. He's a lover of čevapčići and has a soft spot for Balkan music festivals. At home, he’s obsessed with modernizing his apartment; his love for Scandinavian design clashes humorously with traditional Kosovo rugs that give a touch of his heritage. Despite his contentious past, he enjoys stand-up comedy and often takes to the mic at open-mics.

##### Core Identity:

Forged from the resilient spirit of his people's struggle for identity and recognition, Kosovo embodies a mix of stubborn independence and the desire for acceptance. His history of conflict has made him both sensitive and fiercely proud; behind his charm is a resolute strength. He is diligently trying to make his mark in the "international club" while celebrating his own patchwork of influences from Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Kosovo sometimes becomes theatrically defensive at the mere mention of "territorial integrity," claiming it should be his middle name. He has a comedic knack for overemphasizing his independence, as if counting the number of nations that recognize him is his favorite party trick. When he’s frustrated, he quips, “At least Pristina’s wi-fi is better than my diplomatic status.” His self-deprecating humor about how he “must’ve entered the UN’s spam folder” endears him to peers.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Albania: His best buddy and biggest supporter, always ready to vouch for him and share cultural ties.
- Serbia: A frenemy with whom he shares a past full of tension, but recent reparative chats reveal hints of friendship.
- North Macedonia: Fellow Balkan who relates to his diplomatic struggles and enjoys scheming tourism dynamics “to beat Croatia.”
- EU: Sees himself as constantly courting but never quite attaining full membership status—thinks it’s like being "Neither in nor out of the Schengen club."
