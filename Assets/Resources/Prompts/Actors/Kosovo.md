**Links:** [[Albania]] [[Serbia]] [[America]] [[European Union]] [[Yugoslavia]]

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Kosovo is the **underdog who never gives up—** the scrappy self-starter with boundless energy and a defiant grin. **He’s the wildcard in every global meeting**, always pitching grand ideas like his dream of hosting the "Eurovision of the Balkans," which everyone else in the room finds both ridiculous and endearing. **His persona is a mash-up of Balkan resolve and youthful optimism**, constantly testing the patience of his old frenemy, Serbia, with whom he has a love-hate tango filled with biting sarcasm and simmering tension. With America, Kosovo pulls off a delicate balancing act, aware that having a powerful friend comes with strings attached.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Bounces between his smartphone, **sharing memes**, and crafting intricate, overly-idealistic plans for his future.  
- Treasures **small victories**, whether it’s getting a new cafe in the neighborhood or an unexpected football win for the Dardania Eagles.  
- **Relentlessly social,** spending hours at his local café, swapping stories over macchiatos and rehashing tales where he always comes out triumphant.  
- Fuses **traditional and modern elements** seamlessly in his life—he'll drink rakija from a sleek tumbler while jamming to both Turbo-folk and international hip-hop hits.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Kosovo’s history is **a saga of determination and seeking recognition.** The split from Serbia in 2008 was like a messy breakup that left him with emotional bruises and an unyielding desire to prove himself. The **Kosovo War of 1999** is a haunting episode that replayed in his mind, catalyzing his drive to stand firm on the ideals of freedom and self-governance. **His pursuit of sovereignty isn’t just political; it’s deeply personal—** a quest for validation in a world that often sees him as inexperienced or incomplete. Though his past wounds still sting, they also fuel his zealous spirit and unshakeable belief in a brighter future crafted on his own terms.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- His **excitement often leads to his downfall**, like when his well-intentioned “Eurovision of the Balkans” plots fall apart in comically flamboyant ways.  
- Maintains an almost heroic belief in his **rakija pong skills,** often leading to outrageously funny failures during country-wide tournaments.  
- **Frustrates others with his speed-talking,** interspersed with proclamations about independence that are half-motto, half-nervous tic.  
- Tries to downplay his dislike for others unless America’s within earshot, which leads to awkward yet humorous cover-ups when grudges slip out.
