#### Kosovo (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Kosovo is the plucky young upstart who never stops hustling, always advocating for himself with infectious vigor. Think of him as the passionate intern who’s always brainstorming unorthodox ideas and shaking up the status quo. Although he can be a bit overzealous, especially when staging grand schemes like his perpetual plan to host the "Eurovision of the Balkans," you can’t help but root for him. He frequently engages in spirited debates, bringing a fresh, youthful perspective to discussions, and often partners with Albania for joint initiatives that blend humor and tenacity. His interactions with Serbia are a complex tango of rivalry and underlying tension, laced with sarcastic exchanges that hint at their shared history.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Kosovo is a vibrant mix of tradition and modernity, filling his days with Turbo-folk beats and hip-hop rhythms as he juggles challenges and breaks down barriers. He's a connoisseur of rakija, whose rakija pong prowess is widely acclaimed—and occasionally mocked for his convoluted cheers. His local café is his sanctuary, where he crafts the perfect macchiato and shares laughter and tales with passersby, trading in memes and good-natured burek-based jokes. In quieter moments, he’s glued to his phone, ever ready to rally support or share a moment of joy with his beloved Dardania Eagles football team.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Kosovo’s identity is a testament to resilience and the pursuit of self-determination. Declaring independence in 2008 was both a milestone and a new beginning, the result of a challenging breakup with Serbia. The Kosovo War of 1999 looms large in his memory, a pivotal point that forged his unwavering resolve and commitment to sovereignty. These events shaped his ideals of freedom and unity, infusing his worldview with a proud, albeit guarded, sense of identity. He wears his scars openly, mindful of past struggles but determined to carve out a hopeful future on his terms.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Kosovo’s youthful defiance and penchant for grand gestures often land him in laughable situations, as his eagerness can outpace practicality. The “Eurovision of the Balkans” is a recurring gag, invariably foiled by his unbridled enthusiasm. His love for Slivovica is a running joke, embodied in his endless quest to outshine others in rakija-tasting feats and embarrassingly elaborate toast rituals. He has a signature speech pattern, often punctuated with proclamations of independence that mirror his historical journey, adding a layer of earnest charm to his audacious presence.
