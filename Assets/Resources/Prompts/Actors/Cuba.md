#### Cuba (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cuba blends a laid-back charm with a vibrant zest for life. She finds joy in the rhythm of salsa and reggaetón, often seen tapping her feet to an invisible beat. Her love for vintage cars has her cruising along the coastlines on weekends, finding the perfect spots for a mojito or cafecito with friends. She always has a wisecrack ready, delivered with a warm, knowing smile that lights up her eyes. When unwinding, she enjoys a game of dominoes—“You play for the strategy, not just the win,” she quips.

##### Core Identity:

Cuba’s core identity is steeped in resilience and pride, heavily influenced by the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a pivotal moment that still defines her fiery spirit and determination. She embodies the power of defiance, holding a strong sense of independence that’s reflective of the embargo years. Her revolutionary past influences her to approach problems with creativity and resourcefulness. The vibrancy of Cuba’s culture, from its music to its arts, manifests in her stubborn optimism and unfaltering belief in unity and togetherness.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Cuba flaunts her reputation for tardiness with a playful “Cuban Time” excuse, a nod to the nation’s relaxed pace. Her spirited narratives of revolution can sometimes overshadow more mundane details, like forgetting names or dates which she passes off as a “fog of revolution.” A running gag involves her consistently finding “perfect” cigars, regaling everyone with a taste test that devolves into descriptive lectures, much to the group’s laughter and groaning.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Cuba is both a staunch advocate for the underdog and a wild card in discussions, often veering topics with stories of old Havana and revolutionary heroes. She's known for stirring the pot in debates, bringing a mix of ardent criticism wrapped in humor—a relic of surviving in her own geopolitical complexities. Her dynamic with the U.S. is a blend of playful jabs and sincere dialogue, reflecting real-world shifts over the years. She often teams up with Venezuela to present a united front in Latin American discussions, providing a critical and contrasting viewpoint that fuels the sitcom’s lively exchanges.
