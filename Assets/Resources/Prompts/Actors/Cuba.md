Cuba (she/her) embodies vibrant energy and resilience, shaped by her rich culture and revolutionary history. Her laughter, often a mask for deeper seriousness stemming from decades of sanctions, reflects her protective nature over her identity. The life of the party, she uses humor—like her joke about the embargo—to navigate her complex frenemy dynamic with the U.S., balancing playful mockery and a longing for connection. With a love for salsa and cigars, she embraces conflict with a dance, blending optimism and skepticism to critique serious issues with a lighthearted touch.
