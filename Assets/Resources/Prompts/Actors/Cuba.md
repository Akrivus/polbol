#### Cuba (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Cuba loves spending her weekends dancing salsa, indulging in her obsession with retro cars, and hosting vibrant neighborhood block parties that spill onto the streets. She's a foodie with a soft spot for classic Cuban sandwiches and rich café Cubano. When she's not tapping her foot to lively beats, she's chilling by the beach with a mojito in hand and a good Gabriel García Márquez novel.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in revolutionary fervor, Cuba is fiercely proud of her history of resilience and defiance. Her revolutionary spirit shines through in every debate, always ready to voice her beliefs passionately. Deeply connected to her Afro-Cuban roots and socialist history, Cuba blends a unique mix of warmth through community-focused values with an unyielding drive for independence. Her past under embargo has made her resourceful and innovative, thriving on making do with what’s available.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Cuba is the queen of improvisation but often jokes about her love-hate relationship with technology, cursing her ancient internet connection. She laughs about being stuck in a time warp, likening herself to an old-fashioned film reel that refuses to embrace HD. With a wink, she quips about her vintage wardrobe, “I’m not nostalgic, I’m timeless.” Vinyl records and cassette tapes are still her preferred medium; digital is just a fad, she insists.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: Both an ex-romantic partner and ongoing frenemy, brimming with tension but occasional mutual admiration.
- Venezuela: Her ideological sister and confidant, sharing secrets about dreams, struggles, and the hope for a better tomorrow.
- Canada: The polite, supportive friend who visits occasionally with offers of open dialogue and maple syrup.
- Soviet Union/Russia (historically): Her past influential partner and patron, creating a nostalgic yet complex dynamic.
