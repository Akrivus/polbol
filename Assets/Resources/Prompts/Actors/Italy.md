#### Italy (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Italy enjoys leisurely evenings sprawled on his favorite terrazza, sipping espresso, and perfecting his homemade gelato recipes. He’s an avid soccer fan, never missing an AC Milan match, and his emotional outbursts during games are always entertaining. Cooking is not just a passion but a lifeline, as he constantly seeks the perfect tomato sauce to impress his Nonna. His vinyl collection spans from classical opera to modern pop, with Vivaldi and Bocelli sharing space with quirky Italian pop tracks. When not debating with his international friends, Italy indulges in cinema marathons, favoring the poetic yet chaotic films of Federico Fellini.

##### Core Identity:

Grounded in a rich tapestry of Renaissance art, political intrigue, and culinary prowess, Italy carries the weight of history with a blend of pride and existential dramatics. He often waxes poetic about architecture and fashion, channeling centuries of innovation and beauty. Despite political gaffes or scandals, his heart remains in family lounge discussions over lavish meals—setting the cultural narrative of amore e vita. Balancing ancient Rome’s grandeur with modern-day challenges, his zest for life embodies the enduring spirit of la dolce vita.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Italy’s flair for melodrama turns minor inconveniences into operatic crises—an overcooked pasta is a national emergency. He’s humorously indecisive, navigating between tradition and modernity while proclaiming, “When in Rome!” as an excuse for any diatribe or excess. His notorious "Italian time" adds a comedic twist, always arriving fashionably late but with a charming apology in tow.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- France: The sibling rival, always trying to one-up each other in gastronomy and fashion. Despite this, they share a deep bond over a mutual appreciation for fine wine and art.
- Germany: The practical friend who keeps Italy grounded, providing strategic advice in return for culinary tips, leading to a constant joking battle over punctuality.
- Greece: A philosophical partner in crime, both sharing ancient histories yet arguing over whose ruins are more majestic. Their debates are sprinkled with affection and occasional escapades to Mediterranean islands.
