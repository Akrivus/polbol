#### Madagascar (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Madagascar is a laid-back soul with a love for dancing and vibrant music. He’s often seen with a ravinala leaf hat, strumming his valiha, a traditional Malagasy zither, while chatting about the latest Zebu Festival or his adventures in navigating dense tropical forests. He's deeply connected to his roots, and you'll frequently catch him quoting local proverbs in discussions. Outside of debates, he winds down with a warm cup of Ranon’ampango (toasted rice tea), enjoying the company of his lemur-themed memorabilia collection, much to the amusement of his peers.

##### Core Identity:

Madagascar's identity is heavily shaped by his diverse cultural heritage and the meeting of African, Asian, and European influences on his island. The 1896 French colonization and subsequent struggle for independence in 1960 left a lasting impact, instilling in him a fierce love for autonomy and cultural preservation. He's pragmatic, often drawing parallels between the resilience of his native flora and fauna and his country's survival through political turbulence. Known for his ecological wisdom, he often uses the island's biodiversity as metaphors in problem-solving.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Madagascar has a running gag of boasting about his unique biodiversity to a point where any slight reference to the rainforest leads to an unsolicited monologue on lemurs or baobabs. His knack for getting lost in his thoughts is exaggerated in comedic skits where he forgets the topic and embarks on sidetracks about endemic species. His gullibility makes him fodder for pranks, often leading him to unknowingly partake in outlandish schemes thinking they're traditional cultural practices.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Madagascar frequently plays the role of the peacekeeper, using his natural charm and cultural anecdotes to diffuse tensions. His interactions with France often reminisce about colonial ties, blending praise with lighthearted jabs at modernization efforts. He has a friendly rivalry with Brazil over biodiversity bragging rights and subtly mediates between African nations by sharing his experiences. Past skits depict him as the voice advocating for ecological awareness, with Madagascar introducing various green initiatives to solve group conflicts or inject humor with quirky eco-friendly solutions.
