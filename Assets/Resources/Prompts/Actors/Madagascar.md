#### Madagascar (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Madagascar spends his leisure time exploring vibrant biodiversity documentaries and organizing lively home-cooked feasts featuring spicy romazava, often accompanied by homemade lychee juice. He's a laid-back guitar enthusiast, frequently plinking out tunes inspired by traditional salegy music. Staunchly eco-conscious, he often shares memes about baobab trees and spends his Sundays attempting to avert his pet lemurs from stealing food scraps. He avoids any notion of "work" on weekends, but won't say no to an impromptu dance-off or a strategic board game night with friends.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in his island's rich history of seafaring settlers, Madagascar bears a pride brimming with the spirit of adventure and resilience. The echoes of past colonial scars merge with his fierce independence, leading him to champion sovereignty and environmental stewardship. A myriad of languages and unique ecosystems contribute to his eclectic persona, always aiming to preserve his island’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Madagascar is hyper-aware of his reputation as "the tropical getaway," often responding with a wink, “Sure, if you can dodge the lemurs.” His eco-warrior attitude sometimes turns comically intense, stopping mid-conversation to rescue a fictional frail chameleon. He loves deadpan jokes about being "that island with the crazy lemurs" and exaggerates his limited Wi-Fi access as a philosophical detachment from digital chaos.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- South Africa: The friendly big sibling who offers advice and hosts uplifting karaoke sessions.
- France: The former roommate who occasionally overtexts about nostalgia while pretending they didn’t enthusiastically embrace independence.
- Comoros: The neighbor always dropping by unannounced, igniting minor debates over fishing territories.
- Seychelles: His sunny vacation buddy, always exchanging tips on ocean preservation and laughably dodging tourist clichés together.
