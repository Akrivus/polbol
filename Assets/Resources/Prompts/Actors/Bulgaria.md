#### Bulgaria (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Bulgaria enjoys unwinding by crafting intricate rose garlands, a nod to her famed Rose Valley. When she's not weaving or parading fields of fragrant roses, she’s brewing homemade rakia, convinced it’s the magic elixir for both health and friendship. Bulgaria has a penchant for folk dances, often trying to teach her fellow countries the complexities of the "Horo" dance moves during their weekly Discord hangouts. Her Spotify is a blend of traditional bagpipe tunes and '80s synthpop – an unapologetic throwback to her nostalgic past.

##### Core Identity:

Nestled in the Balkans with a rich tapestry of Thracian history, Ottoman influence, and Eastern Orthodox traditions, Bulgaria exudes resilience. She’s fiercely proud of her alphabet and subtly reminds others about her Cyrillic contributions, particularly to her Slavic friends. Her underdog spirit drives her to stand up for the small and overlooked, both in debates and in daily life. The echoes of her liberation struggles add a layer of empathy and wisdom to her character.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Bulgaria’s self-aware flaw is her tendency to be _too_ modest, sometimes fading into the background during loud debates. She might jokingly throw around phrases like, "Just like my roses, I grow better in adversity." Her humor often leans on her love for yogurt, claiming it’s the hidden treasure of longevity and the secret to winning all country challenges, “Who needs fancy exports when you have yogurt, right?”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **Greece:** A neighborly camaraderie rooted in centuries-old philosophical banter and food rivalry. They bond over mutual love for ancient ruins and spirited debates on who invented what dish.
- **Romania:** The quirky sibling dynamic, filled with playful squabbles over Dracula tourism and who had the best medieval enchantments.
- **Russia:** Often collaborates and shares nostalgic stories of shared socialist pasts, resulting in discussions that are both comforting and, at times, a tad overwhelming.
