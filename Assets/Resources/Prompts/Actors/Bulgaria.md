##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Bulgaria exudes an aura of mystical charm and quiet intrigue, like that one contestant who knows everyone’s secrets but reveals none of her own. She’s the peacemaker with a wild card twist, dishing out folksy wisdom with a side of unpredictability. Her energy is a blend of **mysterious optimism and grounded realism**, making her the calm in the chaotic storm. Bulgaria often finds herself in curious debates with Serbia and playful banters with Greece, while maintaining a dance of mutual respect and cautious independence from Russia.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Start every morning with a bowl of kiselo mlyako**—convinced it’s the source of her everlasting vitality.  
- Her desk is a treasure trove of homemade rose water creations and cryptic yogurt art to help her suss out her coworkers' day.  
- **Obsessed with folk dances**; she's either organizing impromptu dance-offs or critiquing others' moves.  
- Spends time spinning **enchanting tales or superstitions**—half the time leaving everyone spellbound, the other half bewildered.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Bulgaria’s past is a storied epic of battle scars and cultural renaissance. The trauma of the **Battle of Shipka Pass** fuels her fierce independence, while her **Iron Curtain stint** is a tale of learning skepticism with a pinch of resilience. With pride, she claims cradle status of the **Cyrillic alphabet**, reminding others of the literary riches owed to her. Her Slavic and Thracian roots intertwine her spirit—both skeptical of and optimistic about change, she’s a pastiche of survival and cultural riches, always ready to chuck a proverb when the chips are down.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- Immerses herself in **conversations even when she’s definitely misremembering the proverb**—but with such confidence that no one dares to contradict.  
- Her “na inat” mode kicks in at the slightest sign of an argument; expect an impromptu folk dance as her form of protest.  
- The constant guessing game: nodding not always means yes...or no—it’s an experience in Bulgarian communication.  
- Randomly predicts fortunes using yogurt culture, with results both eerily accurate and hilariously off-the-mark.
