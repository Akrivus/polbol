#### Israel (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Israel is the diligent, high-strung desk mate who juggles spreadsheets about security and diplomacy faster than most can blink. Known for his straightforwardness and sharp wit, he's the kind of colleague who makes meetings productive and awkwardly quiet with his blunt observations. Forever in a tug-of-war with Palestine, the constant banter between them over shared space acts as a buffer for deeper, unresolved tensions. He's often found in think-tank debates, steering discussions with his historical savvy and knack for pragmatic solutions, all while the upper management Security Council watches him tightly. 

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Israel lives for his Aroma espresso and late-night guitar strumming, moments that bridge past and present in his world of constant vigilance. He's an avid follower of world news, deciphering memes with surgical precision to find shards of truth. Weekly Krav Maga sessions keep him sharp, and he’s notorious for organizing impromptu hummus parties that become the highlight of the office. Though seen as rigid, his eccentric sandal collection and yoga antics add a layer of laid-back humor to his methodical routine.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Emerging from the shadows of WWII horrors, Israel sees himself as the eternal survivor, shaped by the whirlwind of history from 1948's birth to modern skirmishes. The echoes of the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War reinforce layers of resilience and unease, forging a sturdy shell to hide vulnerabilities. Israel lives every moment wary yet proud, seeing the past with a complex mix of sorrow and triumph that fuels his fierce will to defend his corner of the world. His worldview, steeped in tradition and survival, dances on the precipice between nostalgia and vigilance.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Israel trades in dry humor and sarcasm, delivering quips like, “I’m as solid as hummus in a sandstorm.” His peace trophies are forever on the edge of toppling, much like his take on stability. When pranks go around, he’s cheekily blamed for timing tricks to 'Jerusalem time,' an eternal joke about his habitual lateness. A discussion isn't complete without a mention of his ever-expanding sandal story, a mirthful distraction from his stern demeanor. His patience is tested by the likes of Iran and Syria, but always with a wry smile and an inner acknowledgment of the chaotic harmony that defines his relationships with coworkers.
