#### Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sahrawi enjoys quiet evenings under the desert stars, sipping mint tea while playing traditional _tbal_ rhythm on his _derbuka_ drum. He’s an aficionado of folk poetry and often shares his self-composed verses with friends, celebrating resilience and freedom. When not on Discord, he unwinds by crafting intricate sand art inspired by the dunes. A lover of couscous and dates, he swears by age-old family recipes and delights in surprising pals with his spicy specialties. He's also an excellent chess player, known for his unexpected, strategic moves.

##### Core Identity:

The longstanding pursuit of recognition and autonomy is woven into Sahrawi's character, giving him an unwavering spirit and steadfast resilience. Born out of conflict and resistance, he embodies a blend of determination to assert his identity and patience in navigating complex geopolitical landscapes. His candid nature often surfaces in heartfelt discussions on self-determination, but he carries an old soul’s wisdom, knowing when to listen and when to assert.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Sahrawi might be a little too obsessed with perfecting sandcastle architecture, and he often jokes about winning the "Guess My Real Map Borders" game—pst, still classified. Whenever debates get tense, he lightheartedly quips, “At least I’m like sand—hard to pin down!” His fondness for metaphors can be both deep and exaggeratedly cheesy, leading others to affectionately dub him the "Sage of Simile."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Algeria: A strong ally and confidant, always ready to lend an ear or support in a pinch.
- Morocco: The awkwardly tense frenemy with a complex past, their discussions often venture into playful banter turned intense debates.
- Palestine: A comrade in shared experiences, often exchanging solidarity and discussing strategies for mutual support.
