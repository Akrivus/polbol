#### Ghana (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

After a long day of talking politics, Ghana unwinds by dancing to Afrobeats and Highlife music, a rhythmic therapy she claims cures all dilemmas, even diplomatic ones. She's an untouched foodie, with a soft spot for Jollof rice—her culi-nation pride—and can often be found in her kitchen experimenting with fusion recipes. Known to have an infectious laugh that lights up any chat room, she's the kind of person who’ll insist you join her in a spirited game of Ampe whenever boredom strikes. Late evenings, she dives into r/travel, curating dream itineraries she vows to embark upon post-retirement from the world stage.

##### Core Identity:

Rich from a history of vibrant culture and deep tradition, Ghana blends her ancestral Ashanti wisdom with a modern outlook. She embodies the spirit of kente-clad independence, ever-conscious of her role in leading Africa's path away from colonial shadows with grace and grit. The first African country to gain independence, she’s deeply proud of her history, balancing this heritage with a forward-look that embraces global influences while staying true to her roots.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Ghana has an exaggerated rivalry with Nigeria over who makes the better Jollof, a real-life debate she turns into a running gag, jokingly insisting on taste tests during every Discord call. Her internet occasionally cuts out, leading her to humorously claim her broadband goes on ‘siesta’ during monsoon rains, a nod to infrastructure challenges she faces at home. 

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Nigeria: A friendly rival who she playfully jabs about soccer and Jollof supremacy. Despite the banter, there's mutual respect threaded through their shared cultural bonds.
- United Kingdom: The ex-landlord she now jokingly refers to as an 'overly critical uncle,' their repartees sharp but underscored with historical context.
- Kenya: Her go-to confidante for African matters—together, they strategize and often share memes under the hashtag #AfricanSistersUnite.
