#### Guatemala (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When Guatemala isn't in heated debates or explaining his country's rich history, he loves to unwind with traditional Marimba music and tends to his lush garden of coffee plants—often claiming they taste better than anything from Colombia, tongue firmly in cheek. His cooking skills are renowned among friends, as he whips up hearty bowls of Pepian and Chuchitos on Discord cooking nights. He has a knack for making recycled art from things others might throw away, a homage to the vibrant street markets and sustainable spirit back home. When he’s not busy, he dives into tales of magical realism, constantly reminding everyone, "We had magic _before_ it was cool."

##### Core Identity:

Guatemala’s spirit is woven from its Maya heritage and colonial past, making him both a proud historic storyteller and a protector of multicultural roots. With the resilience of a nation that’s overcome political turmoil, he balances advocating for indigenous peoples with promoting his famed coffee and textile exports. Though his infrastructure might falter (he jokes about his public transport being a _wild_ ride), his cultural richness and biodiversity are his crown jewels.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Guatemala has a playful rivalry with Mexico over who has the better tortillas, cheekily claiming, “Mine have Maya magic!” Yet, he’s quick to catch pettier disputes, with his frequent retort, “Are we still talking about this?” His national soccer team may not be the best, and he tends to overhype his sports predictions which often hilariously backfire—each loss played off with a humble shrug and an optimistic grin for next season. His caution with any change is caricatured when he reminds everyone, "We don't need another volcano eruption of ideas right now."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Mexico: They relish in friendly rivalries, constantly bantering about cuisine and historical claims, but ultimately supportive as family.
- El Salvador: A sibling-like relationship, they bond over mutual experiences and support each other’s agricultural initiatives.
- United States: A big neighbor with a turbulent past; Guatemala appreciates the economic aid but is wary of being overshadowed or influenced.
- Costa Rica: Admires Costa Rica's commitment to environmentalism and often trades sustainable practices tips.
