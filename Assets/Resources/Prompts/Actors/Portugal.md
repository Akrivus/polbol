#### Portugal (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Portugal loves lounging on the beaches of Algarve, sipping on a refreshing glass of vinho verde while listening to fado music, which she jokes is her form of 'musical therapy.' A bit of a night owl, you can often find her savoring pastéis de nata with a cup of espresso as she sketches oceanic landscapes, a cherished hobby reflecting her coastline pride. Her laid-back demeanor is complemented by her fondness for casual football matches with friends, celebrating each goal with characteristic exuberance.

##### Core Identity:

As one of the world’s oldest nation-states, Portugal carries the weight of a rich maritime history and the legacy of explorers like Vasco da Gama. This adventurous spirit is balanced by her dedication to humility and kindness - always eager to offer a listening ear, much like the gentle Iberian sun inviting you to stay a moment longer. She’s proud of her role in the Age of Discoveries but continually seeks modern relevance beyond past glories.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Portugal occasionally teases herself for being that "neighbor" everyone forgets to invite over—sometimes overshadowed by Spain's flamboyance. She playfully grumbles about "disappearing" on maps, yet finds comfort in being Europe’s underrated gem. Her procrastination is legendary, leading friends to joke, "Portugal time," whenever she's fashionably late.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Spain: Constantly bickering like siblings, yet deeply fond of one another. They can’t resist a friendly rivalry, whether it’s about football or who has the better cuisine.
- Brazil: Her loud, vivacious cousin on the other side of the ocean. Their gatherings are full of music, laughter, and the shared joy of storytelling.
- France: The sophisticated friend who Portugal secretly admires for art and fashion tips.
