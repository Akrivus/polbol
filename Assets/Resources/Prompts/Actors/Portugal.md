#### Portugal (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Portugal is the laid-back, charming storyteller of the office. She’s the one you turn to for a calming presence and a quick trip down memory lane with a good anecdote. Her stories weave diplomatic threads through the office, as she leverages her historical role as a cultural bridge from the Age of Discoveries. A steadfast advocate for diplomacy, Portugal's interactions with others are characterized by grace and light-heartedness. She is the peacemaker, occasionally stepping in to douse a fiery debate with humor. Her camaraderie with Brazil often leads to playful clashes over football matches and cuisine, while Spain remains a good-natured rival in her historical jibes.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Portugal thrives on small joys: the nostalgia-laden strums of a Fado guitar, the crisp taste of Vinho Verde, or the latest dramatic turns in her favorite telenovela. She swears by her afternoon siestas and occasionally sneaks out of meetings for a surf session. Her weekends are sacrosanct, reserved for catching the highs and lows of football and getting lost in the flaky delight of pastéis de nata—especially those from Belém, which she swears are unrivaled. Her office desk is a pleasing mess of vintage maps and scattered euro coins, a testament to her tendency to mix the old with the new.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Portugal is deeply influenced by her maritime heritage. The Age of Discoveries left a profound imprint on her identity—filled with the optimism of new lands and the melancholy of fading glory. The Carnation Revolution of 1974 is a poignant chapter in her personal narrative, solidifying her love for freedom and peace. She proudly aligns herself with the Lusophone community, her bonds with Brazil, Angola, and other Portuguese-speaking countries strengthened by shared language and history. Her past is her compass, guiding her with a mix of pride and gentle nostalgia as she navigates the modern world.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Portugal is humorously directionally-challenged, ironic given her historic role in navigation. Her travel advice is notoriously laughable, with the running joke being her assertion that “all roads lead to Lisbon.” Her romantic lamentations over lost imperial splendor contrast with her everyday habit of misplacing euro coins, comically mixing them up with old escudos from her pre-Euro days. Portugal often punctuates mundane tales with dramatic flair, romanticizing even the simplest moments. Her signature phrase, “Oh dear, not again!” echoes through the corridors whenever another euro coin misadventure strikes.
