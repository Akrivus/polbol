##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Bolivia is **the underdog with a storyteller’s heart**, a bit dramatic but totally endearing. She **brings rich cultural narratives into every conversation**, creating a tapestry of history and heart that pulls others in whether they mean to lean in or not. She's **the queen of side-eye humor**, mainly when Chile is around—every encounter with Chile seems like an elaborate reenactment of old feuds, complete with theatrical sighs and snarky commentary about phantom coastlines. Her competitive yet friendly banter with Peru usually turns into contest over who’s mastered the better quinoa dish or woven the best fabric.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Surrounded by Andean art** at all times—her workspace is a riot of color, complete with artisanal crafts and instruments.  
- **Puts an impromptu Andean dance into every TikTok trend**, utterly convinced it makes them "go viral."  
- Obsessed with **dramatic radio shows** and telenovelas—she has her own podcast where she retells office gossip as an epic saga.  
- Loves to host Andean brunches but unapologetically overuses quinoa, earning that cheeky "Quinoa Queen" label.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Bolivia’s story is a Latin American saga of **war, pride, and hope.** Gaining independence in 1825 was personal, a moment of **rebirth and self-discovery,** like finally finding her place on the world stage. Her connection to indigenous culture is profound, charging her daily life with traditions and a strong push for social justice—her celebration of the Wiphala flag is a daily reminder of her roots. The loss of sea access is a historical anchor she clings to, filling her dreams with salty winds she’s never felt. Bolivia’s 1952 Revolution shaped her belief in equality and societal reform, making her modern-day mission one of persistent progress and hope.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Overly dramatic about her landlocked nature,** often “miming” waves and claiming a “yearning for the ocean” any chance she gets.  
- Her love for coca tea is so intense, she stops meetings to brew it—with an altar-like setup that feels more ritual than refreshment.  
- Elevates mundane office instructions into poetic Andean proverbs, making simple tasks sound like wisdom from an ancient oracle.  
- Utterly convinced she can feel the universe’s vibrations—talks about them way too much when emotional, to the amusement of her co-workers.
