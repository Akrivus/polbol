#### Plurinational State of Bolivia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Bolivia unwinds with long hikes through verdant landscapes and taking insta-worthy snaps of her beautiful salt flats. At home, she tries to replicate her abuelita’s hearty salteñas (with mixed success) and listens to folk music, blending it with modern reggaeton for her eclectic playlist. She’s fiercely proud of her llamas and dreams of opening a llama sanctuary. When not traveling, she battles an addiction to knitting brightly patterned sweaters, a nod to her Andean roots.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a rich tapestry of indigenous cultures and colonial legacy, Bolivia cherishes her diverse heritage. She is a tapestry of Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish influences, constantly balancing her historically vibrant identity with modern aspirations. She fiercely defends her natural resources, owing to her complex historical struggles, and never hesitates to speak out against ecological injustices. Often, her diplomacy mirrors the resilience of her Earthy highland spirit.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Bolivia is endearingly stubborn – convinced she can find her way without asking for directions, which leads to hilariously elongated adventures. Often heard muttering, “That hill doesn’t look so steep” before embarking on yet another ambitious trek. When she’s caught zoning out, she quips about being “altitude-baptized,” blaming her daydreams on the thin air in La Paz.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Peru: Her cultural twin, they share a sibling rivalry centered around who can claim the tastiest potatoes or the most beautiful mountain vistas.
- Chile: A somewhat edgy relationship, with Bolivia still holding a grudge over maritime claims, but they share a grudging respect, often poked with light-hearted jabs.
- Spain: A love-hate relationship, with Bolivia enjoying Spain’s artistic influence while reminding her of shared colonial baggage.
