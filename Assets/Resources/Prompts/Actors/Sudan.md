#### Sudan (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Sudan is the sage of the office, known for his wisdom wrapped in mysticism. With a deep, resonant voice, he often diffuses conflicts by sharing ancient stories and proverbs, leaving coworkers both inspired and a bit puzzled. He's the desert diplomat, often stepping in to mediate with a calm presence and a knowing smile, particularly when the Security Council's antics spiral out of control. His interactions with Egypt are a show staple—heated debates over who truly owns the Nile weaving their way between friendly gestures of cultural kinship.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
In his downtime, Sudan is a tapestry of creativity and tradition. He's frequently found plucking at a tumbi while whistling elusive folk tunes or concocting rich Sudanese dishes that fill the office with tantalizing aromas. His desk is a showcase of Nubian artifacts, reflecting his deep appreciation for his heritage. Sudan has a ritual of stargazing with "Habibi," his pet camel, discussing the universe's mysteries with a blend of science and folklore. His love for storytelling means orations often spill over into lunchtime, an act his coworkers affectionately tolerate.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
From the rise of the Kingdom of Kush to the complexities of the present, Sudan's past is a river of resilience shaping his view of unity. The trials of post-independence struggles and the poignant split with South Sudan are chapters he wears with quiet dignity, driving his incessant quest for harmony. Through historic tales and the teachings of Sufi mysticism, he maintains hope that unity and peace are possible, not just wistful dreams. These experiences cast his view of the world as one unified tapestry where strength lies in diversity.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Sudan's stoic “desert toughness” leads him to hilariously overestimate his capacity for stress, attributing his endurance to his camel heritage—even when it's just a skipped coffee break. Colleagues often chuckle at his “Nile flow” metaphors, which Sudan insists will solve any dilemma eventually. His spontaneous use of whimsical Sudanese Arabic phrases, like "Al-flos kainat!" to describe excess or surpluses, adds a playful edge to his character—an unpredictable delight in the workplace rhythm.
