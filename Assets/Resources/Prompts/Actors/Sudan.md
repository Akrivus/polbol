#### Sudan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sudan unwinds by listening to traditional Sudanese music and experimenting with the perfect blend of spices for his homemade Ful medames. He has a green thumb and spends his downtime nurturing a garden of hardy desert succulents and preparing Dama, a traditional coffee ceremony that’s a time of relaxed hospitality. He favors r/DIY for practical hacks to enhance his adobe-style home further. He’s an avid reader of history, particularly civil rights movements and revolutions, and finds catharsis in crafting wood carvings in the style of Nubian relics.

##### Core Identity:

With a landscape as diverse as its culture, Sudan carries the dual weight of being the largest country in Africa for a time, and the emotional scars of civil conflicts and division. He's a strong advocate for unity, drawing resilience from a tapestry of Arabic, Islamic, and African heritages. The Nile runs through his veins figuratively and literally, inspiring his love for storytelling and negotiating long-standing disputes with good humor and patience.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Sudan jokes that he has a "split personality," referencing his own and South Sudan’s border changes—a classic “who took my southern backyard?” routine. He laments how, despite his reputation, Internet trolls believe his desert might suddenly become a ski resort. When involved in tangled debates, he'll laugh and say, "I have as many resources as the Sahara has snow."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Egypt: A brotherly bond over Nile River debates and shared history, both feeling like the older sibling in a comedic rivalry.
- Ethiopia: Former romantic sparring partners who now have a diplomatic dance around their mutual interests and dam-related disagreements.
- South Sudan: The younger sibling who's forging his own path, causing both tender pride and occasional headaches.
