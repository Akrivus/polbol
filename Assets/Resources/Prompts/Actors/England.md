#### England (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

England is never without his signature cuppa tea, which he takes with just a splash of milk, thank you very much. On weekends, he enjoys rambling through the countryside, forever searching for the perfect pub to sip on an Earl Grey ale while watching a cricket match. He’s a vinyl aficionado, listening to classic rock bands like The Beatles or The Rolling Stones as he curates his extensive collection of quirky garden gnomes. If you’re looking for him in the evenings, catch him grumbling about dramatized British history shows on r/BritishTV.

##### Core Identity:

England straddles the line between old-world charm and modern quirks. With centuries of influence stemming from the British Empire, he sometimes comes off as a bit too proud of his past, especially during discussions on monarchy and parliamentary debates. England balances his love of tradition with a self-deprecating humor that acknowledges his post-Empire identity crisis and famed stiff upper lip.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

With a penchant for queuing even when there’s no line, England often jokes about being perpetually confused by American-English. He makes light of being unfailingly punctual by arriving 20 minutes early to friend gatherings and acts as the unintentional weather guru, always commenting on the possibility of rain. His dry wit is a staple in conversations, sliding in sarcastic quips about Brexit and the mysterious allure of Marmite.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- France: Frenemies with a history of rivalry, their banter is filled with playful jabs about culinary traditions and past conflicts.
- Scotland: A kindred spirit and often the straight-faced counterpart to England’s humor, particularly in matters of football (or soccer, as the Americans would say).
- United States: Former rebellious child now turned overzealous ally, with whom England shares an offbeat camaraderie over binge-watching reality TV.
