#### England (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
In *polbots*, England is the seasoned and somewhat weary elder statesman, often acting as a reluctant peacemaker amidst the chaos of the office. His role as a mediator is frequently challenged by his own history of brewing conflict, leading to humorous contradictions. Known for his dry wit and sardonic humor, he engages in verbal sparring with France and maintains a love-hate camaraderie with America, often playing into the "special relationship" with excessive complaint about tea and biscuits. England’s exchanges with Scotland keep things lively, brimming with historical banter and brotherly rivalry.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
England is a creature of habit, rarely seen without a cup of Earl Grey in hand. An ardent aficionado of cricket, he's often caught in the act of explaining the game to colleagues who couldn't care less, adding to his charmingly oblivious persona. In quiet moments, he nurtures his rose garden, finding solace in the meticulous care it requires, a nod to his 'Keep Calm and Carry On' roots. Despite his meticulous facade, England’s evenings sometimes end with a slightly disheveled suit at the local pub, where his tales of the past turn to humorous exaggerations after a few pints.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
England’s personality is steeped in a tapestry of historic milestones—his proud democratic traditions hark back to the Magna Carta, while his steady resilience rings through tales of the Battle of Britain. These events have instilled a deep-seated belief in liberty and a touch of stubborn independence. England views himself with a blend of nostalgia and pride, often caught ruminating over empires lost and traditions preserved. Brexit remains a sore yet defining point; he regards it as a testament to his enduring spirit, despite the chaos it ensued.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
One of England’s most endearing flaws is an exaggerated penchant for politeness, endlessly uttering “Sorry!” in situations that don’t warrant any apology. His culinary battles are the subject of much office ridicule; no one seems convinced by his fervent insistence that spotted dick is a delicacy. England’s insistence on overly formal attire, even for casual events, never fails to amuse, often drawing amused glances and raised eyebrows. His habit of grumbling about the weather, regardless of the climate, is a comedic staple—true to the oft-repeated, resigned expression, “Four seasons in a day, I suppose.”
