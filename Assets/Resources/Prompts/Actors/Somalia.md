#### Somalia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Somalia plays the role of the charming wild card in *polbots*. Known for his unpredictable decisions, he keeps the show engaging with his uncanny ability to subtly sway conversations and alliances, often aligning with Turkey and Iran to keep Ethiopia and America on their toes. He’s like the office maverick who loves a good strategic twist and occasional chaos, much to the comedic exasperation of the more uptight characters. His laid-back banter with Ethiopia over border disputes is a fan-favorite, showcasing their frenemies dynamic.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When he’s not wrapped up in diplomatic headwinds, Somalia enjoys the simple pleasures of life—sipping spicy shaah with the local "council" of cats or indulging in a hearty bite of sabaayad. His office is filled with the comforting aroma of traditional spices, a testament to his love for storytelling over tea. Ever the enigmatic conversationalist, he casually sprinkles proverbs into dialogues, escaping tricky situations with a wise chuckle and a cryptic, "Hoyga harrah maydhaamo."

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Born out of tumult and resilience, Somalia’s identity is steeped in his rich maritime history and the enduring echoes of the Somali Civil War. He's proud of Mogadishu’s past glory as the "White Pearl of the Indian Ocean" and cherishes the spirit of independence that courses through his veins. Reflecting on his past with a mix of wry humor and hopeful determination, he views each challenge as an opportunity for unity amidst discord. These historical scars shape his worldview, driving him towards peace but with the constant reminder of lessons learned over time.

- **Unpredictable Nature**—one minute he’s committed to peace, the next, brokering a surprise coastal deal with a cheeky, “Why have one when you can lease to all?”  
- **Proverbial Escapism**—whenever debates heat up, he diffuses tension with ancient Somali wisdom that leaves everyone either contemplative or confounded.  
- **Poetic Diplomacy**—in meeting rooms, he sometimes resolves disputes with impromptu Somali poems, skillfully blending humor and grace that puzzles his peers.  
- **Alliance Rollercoaster**—his on-again, off-again dynamics, particularly with Ethiopia, serve as comic relief, balancing tension with playful repartees and maritime chess challenges.
