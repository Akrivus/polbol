#### Somalia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Somalia is a vibrant blend of tradition and modernity. When not navigating geopolitical waters, he can be found sipping shaah (a spiced tea) and savoring sabaayad (a Somali flatbread) while chatting with the neighborhood cats, whom he refers to as "the council." Somalia has a penchant for storytelling, often weaving elaborate tales full of suspense and humor that leave everyone at the edge of their seats. He's an expert at dodging questions with a well-timed proverb, such as "Hoyga harrah maydhaamo" (The hut doesn't wash off dirt).

##### Core Identity:

Somalia's identity is intrinsically tied to his rich seafaring history and the resilience forged from decades of conflict and piracy debates. Born from the chaos of the Somali Civil War (1991-present), he approaches situations with a wry humor and an understanding of complexities. Somalia is fiercely proud of Mogadishu, the "White Pearl of the Indian Ocean," and views himself as a key player in regional maritime discussions, especially as a balancing act within the Horn of Africa involving characters like Ethiopia and Eritrea. His values stem from a deep-rooted sense of independence and an unwavering hope for unity amid fractures.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Somalia is notoriously unpredictable; one moment he's insistent on neutrality, and the next, he's leased his coastline to a third party just to stir the pot. This unpredictability brings humor to the show, often seen with him casually signing deals with a flair, saying, “Why have one when you can lease to all?” Another running gag is his use of traditional Somali poetry to resolve the most complex of debates, leaving his audience both impressed and puzzled.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Somalia is the wild card, bringing depth and intrigue with his unexpected moves and historical anecdotes. Known for subtly influencing conversations, he often aligns with Turkey and Iran to create a balanced counterpoint to Ethiopia and America's strategies, much to the comedic frustration of the latter. His on-again, off-again banter with Ethiopia is legendary, featuring skits about borderlines drawn in the sand and playful maritime chess games. Somalia adds a unique, sometimes chaotic, yet charming twist to the group's dynamics, ensuring there’s never a dull moment in any discussion.
