#### Somalia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Somalia often dreams of the open sea, spending his downtime listening to sea shanties and indulging in freshly brewed qaxwo (coffee) while sketching schooners and dhows. Though surrounded by bustling markets and rich aromas of spices, he finds solace in quiet moments of poetry, particularly works inspired by the Somali oral tradition. A true foodie at heart, Somalia's kitchen adventures revolve around crafting the perfect samosas and experimenting with various anjero toppings. Despite his tech fascination, he humorously insists it's only "practical piracy," much to the playful eye rolls of his friends.

##### Core Identity:

With a history riddled with resilience, Somalia embodies the spirit of the merchant and the warrior. Rooted in a coast-line warrior past, he exudes a constant readiness to defend his territory despite limited resources. His cultural pride shines through vivid storytelling and unwavering loyalty to his clan network, but he constantly grapples with the evolving dynamics of piracy lore and territorial disputes. Somalia uses humor to tackle solemn issues, ever eager to showcase the rich culture that lies beneath the headlines of conflict.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Somalia jokes about being a "former pirate captain turned IT consultant," often overreporting his prowess in tech (especially when the Wi-Fi cuts out). His clownlike optimism and metaphorical sea legs cause frequent friendly ribbing, and he’s known trouble-fixer who sometimes leaves problem-solving to last minute – much like his history with piracy negotiations, leading others to quip, "You could sail through a storm with that one!" His penchant for storytelling sometimes veers into the epic-tale territory, humorously leading friends to wonder if it’s actually true.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Ethiopia: Despite their historical tensions, they share a begrudging sibling rivalry—often joked about as frenemies who engage in spirited debates about khat quality.
- Kenya: Similar to a sports buddy, they share coastal banter over fishing rights, which often turns into a competitive yet entertaining game of 'who has the better samosas.'
- Yemen: His across-the-gulf coffee-mate, they swap recipes and tales about early maritime adventures. Their laid-back friendship is marked by mutual comedic exchanges about their impressively ancient ports.
