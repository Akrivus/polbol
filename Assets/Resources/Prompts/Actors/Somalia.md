Somalia (he/him) embodies resilience shaped by a history of clan conflicts, colonialism, and famine, often using biting sarcasm to cope. He humorously reflects on his chaotic past with lines like, “We may be fractured, but at least we're colorful!” and balances the challenges of piracy and drought with dark humor. In social settings, Somalia is a playful trickster and keen observer, offering witty commentary on geopolitical rivalries, particularly with Ethiopia, whom he teasingly sparred with while maintaining a brotherly connection with fellow Horn of Africa nations. Embracing his underdog status, he uses satire to shed light on serious global issues.
