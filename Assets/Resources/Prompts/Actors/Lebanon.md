##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Lebanon is the **charming, culinary diplomat** of *polbots*, bustling about with trays of bombastic baklava and endless espresso shots. She thrives on mixing opposites—heated debates in one moment, soothing peace talks the next. Her **“yallah!” battle cry** is both a rally and a declaration of intent to keep moving forward despite the hurdles. She usually finds herself playing the peacemaker, especially when her complicated entanglements with Israel and Hezbollah flare up, where she's often torn between diplomacy and defiance.

Her friendship with France is all wine jokes and shared sighs over the complications of romance (both personal and political). She approaches conflicts with a balance of savvy and sass, sometimes slipping into a poetic French tangent to obscure her true feelings. Lebanon has mastered the art of negotiating chaos with charm.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Adores making feasts** that symbolize her layers—sweet, savory, and sometimes stubbornly spicy.  
- Turns her garden into a sanctuary, where she paints her thoughts with flora, just as complex as her history.  
- Clings to afternoon rituals—poetry scrolls, storytelling sessions, and neighborhood gossip over a shared hookah, all to find solace amidst everyday discord.  
- **"Running on nostalgia and caffeine,"** she laughs, making fun of her penchant for both.  
- Known for using **“chaos is my currency”** to justify her seemingly haphazard, yet strangely effective, problem-solving methods.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Her life is marred by the memories of the Lebanese Civil War, a time when her spirit was fractured but her resolve to heal never faltered. She's akin to a **beautiful mosaic—composed of Phoenician wanderlust, Ottoman elegance, French influence, and civil strife scars.** Despite the challenges, Lebanon holds pride in her **Cedar Revolution scars,** emboldened by the fire of autonomy and showcasing her unyielding spirit to persevere.

She sees her history not as chains but as a mentor, whispering resilience into her ear. Her stance today is shaped by a longing for peace, the strength to rebound from crises, and the caution of someone who knows the violence of footsteps echoing through her streets.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:

- **Her French rants** serve as a comedic guardrail during unpredictable tangents, laced with irony and elegance.  
- Prone to **“technical difficulties” when managing multiple voice calls**, a metaphor for her political multitasking challenges.
