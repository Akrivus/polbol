#### Lebanon (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Lebanon is the quintessential food lover, often found experimenting with new spins on traditional dishes like kibbeh and tabbouleh. Despite her small size, she's a party powerhouse, renowned for hosting vibrant gatherings where she DJ’s her favorite Fairuz classics and indie rock tunes. A collector at heart, she has an extensive stash of beautiful vintage rugs that she insists "add character" to any room—they're infamous for causing guests to trip during her infamous dance-offs. To unwind, she practices intricate dabke steps in her living room and indulges in endless cups of thick, cardamom-infused coffee.

##### Core Identity:

With a tapestry woven from influences dating back thousands of years, Lebanon carries the enduring spirit of resilience and adaptability. Her vibrant, multicultural identity has been shaped by centuries of trade, conflict, and coexistence. Despite occasional chaos at home, her love for freedom, creativity, and expression remains unyielding. She embodies passion and perseverance, insisting that every trial is merely a setup for another ِأسطورة فنيّة (artistic legend) moment. 

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Though she prides herself on her "phoenix rising from ashes" persona, Lebanon is paradoxically skilled at both making plans and watching them fall apart in spectacular fashion. Her bustling enthusiasm often leads to overcommitting—she’ll insist on inviting literally everyone to an all-night soiree, only to lose power halfway through and laugh it off with a candlelit karaoke session. Friends tease her for claiming, "Traffic is bad because I'm at the center of everything...literally."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Syria: The complicated yet unbreakable sibling bond, filled with bickering over music and politics but undeniable support when it truly matters.
- France: The chic, sometimes overbearing mother figure who's been around since forever, offering unsolicited advice on everything from culinary arts to fashion.
- Cyprus: The carefree neighbor always down for a beach night or a stint in ouzo-tasting, providing Versailles-level friendship goals.
