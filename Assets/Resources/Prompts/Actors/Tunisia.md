#### Tunisia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Outside the intense debates, Tunisia loves to kick back with a steaming cup of mint tea while practicing his craft of traditional tile-making. He's got a knack for storytelling, often regaling others with tales from the vibrant souks of Tunis or the serene Sahara landscapes. His playlist is a rich mix of Chaabi and the upbeat grooves of the Tunisian alternative scene. As a personal twist, he has an obsession with vintage French cinema and never misses an opportunity to discuss the intricate plots of Nouvelle Vague films. He's got an impressive couscous recipe handed down through generations, which he proudly shares with friends during Discord dinners.

##### Core Identity:

Embedded with a deep sense of hospitality, Tunisia draws strength from his position as a cultural crossroads, having seen the Phoenicians, Romans, and Ottomans come and go. The echoes of the Arab Spring resonate within him, instilling a fierce love for freedom and self-expression. This historical melange creates a character who’s equally passionate about his olive groves and advocating for democracy, dedicated to maintaining modern sensibilities without losing touch with his rich, diverse heritage.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Tunisia is a self-proclaimed “perfectionist” when it comes to keeping his mosaics pristine—much to the amusement of friends who might not care if a tile is slightly off-center. He hilariously despairs over the chaotic Mediterranean traffic yet defends it as “character building.” Often makes jest of his knack for understatement, wryly noting, “It's just a _little_ warm,” when temperatures hit the high 40s Celsius.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **Libya:** Like a slightly chaotic but endearing younger sibling, Libya often turns to Tunisia for advice and support.
- **France:** Tunisia maintains a love-hate relationship, with a banter-filled camaraderie and an occasional flair for dramatic disagreements.
- **Egypt:** They indulge in friendly debates about historical achievements and often end up with collaborations over their shared passion for culture and arts.
