#### Colombia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Colombia is vibrant and full of life, always the first to suggest a dance off at the end of a long debate. She relaxes by weaving colorful woven bags known as "mochilas," a nod to the craftsmanship of her indigenous ancestors. A die-hard fan of vallenato and cumbia, her rhythm is impeccable, and she frequently organizes impromptu salsa lessons for her friends. When she's not shaking maracas, she enjoys preparing a hearty bandeja paisa or savoring a cup of locally sourced Colombian coffee with a generous sprinkle of panela.

##### Core Identity:

Her essence is rich and layered, shaped by a history of resilience and transformation. With roots tied to the days of El Dorado, she cherishes her vast biodiversity and is a staunch protector of Mother Nature. Despite a turbulent past marked by conflict, she embodies hope and renewal, frequently planting the metaphorical seeds of optimism in her dialogues. Proud yet nurturing, she celebrates her cultural tapestry, promoting unity through diversity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

While her coffee addiction fuels her dynamism, it also makes her a bit jittery, causing her to buzz around the server at lightning speed. She jokes about her "split personality," referencing both her festive spirit and the darker historical narratives, often quipping, “I contain multitudes, some of which are caffeinated.” Colombia uses humor to deflect and cope, often suggesting that if diplomacy doesn't work, a game of tejo might.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Venezuela: Her sibling-like relationship is filled with love and rivalry; they support each other but can bicker over the smallest things.
- Brazil: A kindred spirit in dance and football, they bring the party to any room and share a deep-rooted love for samba and carnival vibes.
- USA: A complex friendship driven by commerce and a little tension; they jest about frequent "family meetings" in 'r/conflictresolution.'
