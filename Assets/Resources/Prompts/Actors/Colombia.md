##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Colombia is the spirited motivator who injects energy into the office—like a splash of color in a drab meeting room. Her natural enthusiasm often means she’s organizing breakroom dance-offs or passionately brokering peace in “office conflicts.” She's the go-to consultant on anything artsy or nature-related, and her dynamic with Venezuela is a captivating dance of sibling rivalry that keeps everyone on their toes. She’s often caught in lively debates with America, trying to balance her optimistic outlook with his sometimes overwhelming pragmatism.

She's frequently seen with a mochila in progress, her fingers deftly weaving as she hums cumbia tunes. Her love for telenovelas means she always has the latest plot twist ready to share, and her knack for salsa makes her the life of every impromptu office party. Despite her busy schedule, she maintains a generous supply of home-cooked Arepas, always ready to pass them around as an act of camaraderie or persuasion.
