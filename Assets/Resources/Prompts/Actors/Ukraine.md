#### Ukraine (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Ukraine loves nothing more than to unwind with a hearty bowl of borscht and her prized homemade varenyky, while listening to folk music that reminds her of summer evenings in the countryside. In her free time, she enjoys embroidering intricate designs that reflect her rich heritage, and she’s slightly obsessed with watching woodworking videos on YouTube, fantasizing about turning her apartment balcony into a rustic wooden retreat. She is fiercely proud of her sunflower garden, tending to it as a personal sanctuary. To stay active, Ukraine often participates in lively traditional dance classes that she jokingly calls her "cultural cardio."

##### Core Identity:

Deeply shaped by her history of resilience and cultural renaissance, Ukraine embodies a spirit of perseverance mixed with a longing for sovereignty and self-expression. She has a fervent national pride, stemming from her historical struggles for independence and a vibrant, diverse cultural heritage. This gives her a strong, defiant nature, tempered by a warm, inviting hospitality. Her heart beats with a love for liberty, often reflecting on poetry and literature that has kept her spirit alive through challenging times.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

She has an exaggerated obsession with proving herself capable and independent, often leading her to biting off more than she can chew, like attempting to knit 100 scarves for charity—by hand. She jokes about the perpetual cloud of uncertainty hanging over every plan she tries to make, but laughs it off, exclaiming, “At least my power outages are spontaneous!” Her humor is as dry as her homemade horilka, peppered with self-deprecating jokes about her bouts of stubbornness, rivaled only by her fierce loyalty to her friends.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Poland: Her best friend and partner-in-crime who shares her love for dumplings and historical anecdotes, often joining forces for cultural festivals and dance-offs.
- Russia: The complicated neighbor with a love-hate relationship, known for their intense, sometimes heated debates over national identity and boundaries in every episode.
- Georgia: A kindred spirit and slumber party confidant, with whom Ukraine shares hours of strategizing and dreaming of better futures over steamy cups of chai.
