#### Norway (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Norway embodies the enigmatic yet insightful strategist at the *polbots* office. He's the wise sage who stays quiet during meetings but delivers game-changing insights when he speaks. Norway's presence is calming yet mysterious, often seen as the one who can mediate heated debates with his composed demeanor. He has a peculiar habit of "suddenly going to contemplate life under the Northern Lights" in the middle of intense discussions, which leaves his colleagues amused and occasionally confused. His dynamic with Sweden is a hilarious blend of age-old rivalry and deep-seated camaraderie, while his partnership with Denmark is the catalyst for lighthearted chaos, infusing moments of mirth during tense situations.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
When not engaged in diplomatic deliberations, Norway retreats to his happy place—amidst nature's majesty. He takes solitary hikes through the fjords, indulging in the tranquility they provide. A devout fan of traditional craftsmanship, he knits wool sweaters, spreading warmth and "koselig" vibes, especially through the dark winters. Norway's life boasts a juxtaposition of black metal riffs and serene Grieg symphonies, speaking to the dichotomy within him. His insatiable love for coffee led to the creation of his own mobile caffeine hub, humorously known as "a personal fjord of java," where intense brews fortify him for day-to-day challenges.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Rooted deeply in exploration and defiance, Norway's identity is an intricate tapestry of historical valor and modern progress. Descendant of the Vikings, his fearlessness and commitment mirror his ancestors' adventures. The serene yet determined spirit shown during the 1905 Union Dissolution from Sweden echoes in his actions. Discovering North Sea oil thrusted him into an era of self-reliance and molded his conscientious stewardship over the environment. He holds social welfare and equality close to heart, manifested in his robust involvement in international peace efforts. Norway regards his past with a blend of pride and wisdom, using his history as guiding light rather than a relic, inspiring him to champion sustainability and collaborative diplomacy today.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Norway’s penchant for introspection causes his habitual disappearing acts, where he "ponders life's mysteries" instead of engaging directly with chaos—a humorous trait that's fondly acknowledged around the office. His humor is arid and layered, offering deadpan deliveries that leave peers replaying his words days later, uncertain if they were jokes or profound truths. Among his colleagues, Norway frequently suggests moving to Mars to evade Earthly conflicts, a nod to his space initiatives and his naturally dry wit. His distinct manner of gazing intently during conversations, as though perpetually seeking deep meaning, is his signature, endearing and slightly perplexing, making him a captivating, memorable presence in any discussion.
