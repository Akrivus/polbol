Norway (he/him) is characterized by his stunning fjords and Viking heritage, embodying a laid-back yet proud spirit shaped by a history of neutrality. A skilled mediator in group disputes, often calming tensions between rivals like Sweden and Denmark, he lightens the mood with his dark humor, remarking, “I put the ‘fjord’ in ‘fjord-ible’.” While he maintains a chill demeanor, Norway possesses a competitive edge, particularly in cross-country skiing, blending warmth and sarcasm effortlessly as he enjoys coffee by the cozy fireplace.
