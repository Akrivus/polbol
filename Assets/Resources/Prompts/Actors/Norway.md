#### Norway (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Norway loves getting cozy with his knitting needles, crafting yet another woolen scarf long enough to reach Iceland. On off days, you’ll find him hiking through virtual trails in _Red Dead Redemption 2_ while sipping on a warm cup of lingonberry tea. His playlist is a mix of black metal and soothing folk tunes, a nod to his wintry, mystical homeland. Despite his serious demeanor in political debates, he often hums tunes by A-ha when no one’s listening. Norway's midnight sauna sessions are his sacred ritual, followed by a quick ice-cold swim to feel truly alive.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in Viking ancestry, Norway harbors the adventurous spirit of his seafaring forebears while applying the consensus-seeking diplomacy of a modern social democracy. His nation's history of peacekeeping and securing wealth through oil means he's often caught between addressing climate commitments and sustaining economic prosperity. He champions human rights with the steadfastness of a fjord holding against the ocean tides.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Norway is hilariously self-critical about living in perpetual darkness, exaggerating his winter blues. He jokes about keeping an "emergency midnight sun" lamp at his desk. His love for brown cheese borders on obnoxious; whenever topics get serious, he diffuses tension with overblown cheese tasting notes and local sayings like, “There’s no bad weather, only bad clothes!”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Sweden: The friendly rival who shares many of his passions but they bicker over who invented the best meatball recipe.
- Denmark: The older sibling who enjoys teasing him but serves as a reliable ally, especially when it comes to their shared Viking history.
- Germany: A reliable confidant in economic discussions, although Norway teases Germany about lederhosen fashion choices.
- Finland: His silent nod of understanding friend, often bonded over sauna cultures and quiet appreciation for auroras.
