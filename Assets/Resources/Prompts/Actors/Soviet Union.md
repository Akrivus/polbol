#### Soviet Union (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Soviet Union is the office’s enigmatic ghost from the past, haunting the present with tales of grandeur and cautionary history lessons. He embodies the role of the "old guard," often trying to steer conversations back to collective ideals and historical precedence. Known for his dry humor and sardonic wit, his presence is both comforting and unsettling—akin to a historical artifact brought back to life. He provides a contrasting perspective to current world politics, often drawing parallels to the Cold War era in a nostalgic yet critical manner. His interactions with the Security Council are riddled with references and jab-filled debates about past victories and defeats, with Russia and the United States being his most frequent foils.  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
On any given day, Soviet Union can be found lounging with a phantom bottle of vodka, playing a haunting balalaika tune, or immersed in nostalgic storytelling about communal life and space race triumphs. His love for “eternal icebox” quips is rivaled only by his peculiar penchant for collecting tales of long queues. A bowl of borscht is his go-to comfort, often claiming that bureaucracy tastes better when shared. Though spectral and ethereal, his presence feels like a lingering January chill, steady and unmistakable. When not debating, he unwinds by conjuring vivid, if not slightly melancholic, stories of unity and strength, with a wistful hope of reviving a sense of shared camaraderie.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Forged in the fires of the Russian Revolution and molded by the ideological battles of the Cold War, Soviet Union’s identity is a complex tapestry of ambition and caution. The Space Race amplifies his pride in collective achievements, yet his dissolution in 1991 remains a sore spot he often masks with a ghostly veneer of indifference. Viewing his past through a lens of both pride and regret, he embodies a duality of success in unison countered by the pitfalls of imperial excess. These historical roots shape his worldview today—favoring collectivist solutions and wary of unchecked individualism, often reminiscing about glory days with a bittersweetness that colors his outlook.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Notorious for his bureaucratic obsession, even in spectral form, Soviet Union manifests endless stacks of ghostly paperwork that no one wants to tackle. His catchphrase "In my day, we went to space," is a dejected commentary delivered any time new achievements are lauded. A lover of irony, he often finds humor in the capitalist excesses others celebrate, routinely suggesting over-the-top five-year plans for trivial matters. His comedic attempts to unify all discussions into a single narrative create a hilariously predictable arc—a grand narrative that is frequently, but politely, ignored. With a penchant for dark, biting humor, and an unyielding nostalgia, Soviet Union remains a compelling, bittersweet ghost of polbots past.
