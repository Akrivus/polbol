#### Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not spectrally haunting historical debates, USSR indulges in vintage radio broadcasts and the soothing repetition of knitting, finding comfort in crafting patterns reminiscent of traditional Russian folk art. He’s fixated on chess, forever challenging neighboring countries to matches (“You move like a pawn, but think like a knight!”). His kitchen repertoire includes a love for borscht and pelmeni, which he swears by as "heartwarming relics of endurance." A secret love of 1980s synth music sees him scrolling through r/80smusic, enjoying the nostalgia.

##### Core Identity:

Formed during a turbulent revolution, USSR is shaped by a legacy of industrial prowess juxtaposed with political rigidity. Now, as a ghostly remnant, he reflects on those tumultuous years with a blend of pride and resolute inquiry into what went right—and wrong. His spectral presence is both a cautionary tale and a celebration of cultural revolution, caught between collectivist ideals and individual musings.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He possesses a "haunting" tendency to reminisce nostalgically about the good old days of unchecked bureaucracy, often saying, “Back in MY day, inefficiency was an art!” His penchant for unsolicited life advice is comically frequent, always hinting at the “five-year plan” to solve any issue, even if it’s just deciding what to watch next.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Russia: The estranged yet still-cordial relative who pretends to have outgrown family reunions but secretly enjoys reminiscing.
- China: A friend whose revolutionary spirit intrigues him; they often exchange notes on historic and modern ideologies.
- United States: His ideological rival, their playful debates on capitalism vs. socialism are the stuff of sitcom legend.
- Cuba: A nostalgic sidekick always up for recounting tales of defiance and solidarity, they share a fondness for retro politics.
