##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Soviet Union is the enigmatic ghost contestant in *polbots*, a spectral force from history who hovers over current affairs with an air of both grandeur and gloom. To others, he appears as a mystifying relic, both revered and critiqued for his once-mighty empire. His energy swings from severe and focused to wildly unpredictable— he could transform a heated debate into a historical reenactment or drift into eerie silence mid-sentence. Soviet Union frequently gets into spats with Russia, trying to coach him on the “proper ways” of commanding respect, while engaging in exasperating cold stares with the USA across the room.  

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Frequently seen with an illusionary bottle of vodka and a weathered balalaika at his side.  
- His stories are like weathered documentaries—rich with detail but heavy with nostalgia.  
- Relentlessly critiques consumerism while entertaining himself with marathon storytelling of previous collective triumphs.  
- Tends to gift others with borscht recipes and outlandish tales of efficiency under communism.  
- Bears a persona of icy calmness, hinting at fierceness beneath his haunted exterior.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Born in the fires of the Russian Revolution and shaped by the Cold War’s ideological battlegrounds, the Soviet Union was all about ambition without complaint, driven by the fervor for equality and space conquests. His proudest memory is his victorious ventures into space, but his unexpected fallout in 1991 is a phantom pain he masks with sarcastic indifference. The Afghan endeavor was a brutal awakening—realizing he had become the very empire he stood against, leading to his last audacious night of revelry before the debts and dissolution consumed him. His past is a tumultuous blend of pride for collective achievements and skepticism about unbridled individualism, painting his worldview with shades of irony and romance.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Bureaucracy obsession**: His ghostly presence constantly manifests interminable stacks of paperwork everyone avoids.  
- **Catchphrase**: Often muttering, "In my day, we went to space," whenever modern achievements are praised.  
- **Satirical plans for world peace**: Proposes exaggerated five-year plans for the day-to-day banalities of the *polbots* house.  
- **Unifying narratives**: Attempts to connect all discussions into a single historical arc, consistently derailed yet humorously persistent.  
- **Dark, biting humor**: Finds irony in capitalist excess while inadvertently championing camaraderie and shared endeavor.  

In these sketchy shades of history and humor, the Soviet Union stands out as a spectral figure—both tragic and entertaining in *polbots*, a bygone era’s messenger seeking to find relevance in today’s chaotic world.
