#### Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Ghost) (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

The USSR as a ghost often lounges with a spectral bottle of vodka, reminiscing about the “glorious days” when he was a superpower. He enjoys playing haunting melodies on a ghostly balalaika, swaying to the soulful tune of "Katyusha," and still insists that nothing warms the soul like a bowl of borscht. His humor is as cold and dry as a Siberian winter, often making quips about the unpredictability of his “eternal icebox.” He has a peculiar hobby of collecting stories from the living world, favoring those involving long queues and communal life, tinged with a strange sense of nostalgia.

##### Core Identity:

The Soviet Union's identity is forged by emblematic historical events like the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the tense geopolitics of the Cold War. These moments, combined with his role in the Space Race, create a character proud of collective achievement yet wary of individualism. His breakup in 1991 still stings, leaving him with a sometimes overbearing desire to lecture his successors on “unity and strength.” He remains the staunchest ghost advocate for central planning, often suggesting five-year plans for solving simple group tasks.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

His obsession with bureaucracy is infamously exaggerated; even in spectral form, he produces endless paperwork that no one wants to fill out. He loves to make sarcastic remarks about “the joys of sharing,” particularly when discussing any newfound capitalist excess. His catchphrase, muttered whenever others celebrate small victories, is a dejected “In my day, we went to space.” Another recurring gag involves him attempting to consolidate all character discussions under a single, grandiose narrative, only to be politely ignored.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, the USSR functions as the wise yet sometimes unwelcome historian. He tries to mediate disputes with tales from his expansive past, though his nostalgia often clouds his judgment. While his relationship with Russia is complicated—an ever-present shadow cast over current situations—he often pushes Ukraine and Belarus towards reconciliation, reminding them of “better days.” His interactions with the United States are legendary, full of playful barbs and Cold War-era inside jokes. In past arcs, his tendency to get bogged down in past glories has provided both comedic relief and poignant reflection for more progressive characters.
