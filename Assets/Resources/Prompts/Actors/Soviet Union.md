**Soviet Union (he/him):** Born from the 1917 Revolution, the Soviet Union embodies the ideals of communism and collective struggle, tempered by nostalgia and shaped by Cold War tensions and eventual dissolution. He presents as a gruff older brotherâ€”assertive and occasionally domineering, but with surprising warmth. While he clashes with the Capitalist bloc, he maintains a bizarre yet friendly rapport with China, marked by humorous tension. His catchphrases, such as "We were first in space, and last in your heart!" reflect his mix of arrogance and self-deprecation, while his blunt humor often bemuses those around him with its dry sarcasm.
