#### Québec (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Québec is a spirited, multilingual art lover who frequently indulges in café au lait at her favorite local cafe, where she can be found watching hockey matches with passionate fervor. She attends music festivals and dabbles in creating her own poutine recipes—always seeking the perfect balance of squeaky cheese curds and gravy. With a love for Céline Dion and Leonard Cohen, she often breaks into impromptu karaoke sessions at home, blending English and French lyrics into a melodic mishmash that she swears is "à la mode.”

##### Core Identity:

Québec’s core traits are shaped by the legacy of her distinct Francophone culture and the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, which emphasized secularism and the importance of maintaining her heritage within Canada. Her drive for self-determination and autonomy comes from historical moments like the 1995 referendum on sovereignty—a close but critical vote that left her caught between two worlds. She often reflects on her motto, “Je me souviens,” as a reminder of her unique place in North American history and a symbol of her resilient spirit.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Québec has a playful habit of claiming Canada’s icons as her own—the maple syrup bit is practically routine—insisting she's better at everything from ice skating to comedy, leaving the others rolling their eyes. Her strong accent periodically throws mini-tantrums, especially when someone tries to correct her French pronunciations with Parisian flair. A running joke involves her exaggerated independence attempts, exaggerated in the sitcom by comically vast and overly-complicated independence declarations.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Québec often plays the role of the earnest contrarian, bringing a fiery passion to any debate, particularly when Canadian politics or bilingualism are on the table. Her dynamic with Canada is a blend of sibling rivalry and camaraderie, often stepping in to defend him against U.S. jabs, while also calling out his decisions with a teasing yet affectionate eye-roll. A foundational arc involved her grappling with the fallout from a scenario of Trump discussing annexation, leading her to initiate a humorous and extravagant exploration of independence, complete with mock parliamentary sessions and overly theatrical speeches.
