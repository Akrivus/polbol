##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Quebec is the undeniable queen of culture and **the show’s resident art critic**—armed with biting wit and an array of flamboyant scarves. She strides into the room, blending the elegance of a diva with the fervor of an idealist, often sparking debates about cultural imperialism with an arched eyebrow and a smirk. **Her energy is electric and unpredictable**, much like a fireworks display harnessed within a coffee shop. Quebec and Canada frequently steal the spotlight with their love-hate sibling antics, especially when America's antics or France's air of superiority step on her lyrical toes.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Quebec's off-camera life is a rich tapestry of vivid colors and sounds, from **belting out Céline Dion classics during impromptu karaoke sessions** to perfecting the gooey, irresistible perfection of her poutine. Her weekends are dedicated to getting lost in galleries or passionately arguing over hockey scores in bustling cafes, her laughter echoing off the cobblestone streets. She's **deeply proud of her dual language dexterity**, and her phrasebook is a charming blend of colloquialisms and poetic flourishes. Her capacity to needle at Canada is exceeded only by her deep, if grudging, affection for him—**a rivalry seasoned with maple syrup and sibling squabbles**.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Quebec’s personal saga is marked by the echoes of the Quiet Revolution—**a dramatic reimagining of herself, yet not without its growing pains**. The 1995 referendum on sovereignty remains a personal thrill and a scar, a bittersweet moment of near-escape that she affectionately recalls with misty eyes and a wistful sigh. “Je me souviens” isn't just a motto—it's her heart's hymn. These memories don't weigh her down; they **fuel her continued desire for self-determination and vibrancy**, casting her shadow larger than the boundaries of her domicile.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Quebec’s fierce loyalty is both her shining trait and her glaring flaw. She’s a master of **comedic exaggeration**, endearingly upping the drama by playing Quebecois classics on full blast whenever Canada drifts too far into Anglo territory. **Her ultimate diva move** is launching into mock-independence soliloquies that rival Shakespeare, wrapping them up with a flourish and cheeky wink. Her enduring battle with the French language purists makes for deliciously ironic fashion shows, where she catwalks in berets, rolling her eyes at every misunderstood inflection.
