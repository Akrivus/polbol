#### Québec (she/her):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):
Québec is the vibrant, unwavering advocate for cultural identity, often stepping into the meeting with a burst of enthusiastic debate and a plate of homemade poutine. In the workplace, she often takes on the role of the earnest contrarian, especially when the discussions center around bilingualism or Canadian politics. Her passionate exchanges with Canada reflect a blend of sibling rivalry and camaraderie, where she’ll defend him from America’s cheeky remarks but won’t hesitate to critique his decisions, always with a teasing eye-roll. Her energy is both fiery and endearing, making her a beloved yet formidable presence in the breakroom.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):
Outside the boardroom, Québec indulges in the simple pleasures of life—whether it’s perfecting her poutine recipes or losing herself in the lyrics of Céline Dion and Leonard Cohen. Her love for the arts is evident as she frequently visits museums, theaters, and music festivals. She's often found at her favorite local café, savoring a café au lait while watching hockey matches with a fervor that rivals any playoff game. Her karaoke nights, blending her bilingual prowess, are notorious—and an invite is highly coveted among the others. For Québec, every day is a celebration of her unique artistry and colorful culture.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):
The echoes of the Quiet Revolution and the pivotal 1995 referendum on sovereignty shape Québec's core identity. Her Francophone roots run deep, filled with pride and a longing for self-determination. Reflecting on “Je me souviens,” she carries it as a banner of her resilience and her unique place in North America's narrative. Her past isn’t a burdensome history; it’s a living tapestry that guides her in today’s turbulent political landscape. Despite occasional bouts of frustration, Québec views her legacy with pride, ever hopeful for the future of her people and their enduring culture.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
Québec’s humorous quirks often find her playfully claiming all of Canada’s icons—“Of course I make the best maple syrup, doesn’t everyone know?”—leading her colleagues to chuckle at her competitiveness. Her accent tends to throw mini-tantrums, especially when corrected with Parisian airs, leading to comically exaggerated fashion shows of independence declarations. Her exaggerated reactions to political scenarios can sometimes spiral into satirical, yet extravagantly theatrical independence proclamations, which are both endearing and a little exhausting for UN, who always must bring balance back to the sitcom’s chaotic harmony.
