**North Macedonia (she/her):** Emerging from Yugoslavia, North Macedonia embodies resilience and identity struggles, fighting for recognition amid ancient rivalries and name disputes. With a blend of fierce independence and playful defiance, she turns geopolitical debates into lively dances, often showcasing her rich folk traditions. Close to her Balkan friends but cheeky with Greece, she humorously exaggerates her size, stating, “I may be little, but I’ve got big dreams!” North Macedonia navigates the world with spirited drama and infectious charm, ready to lighten serious discussions.
