#### North Macedonia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

North Macedonia is the friend who's low-key fun but gets overshadowed at parties. She enjoys traditional folk dancing, especially the oro, which she insists is better than yoga for balance and coordination. In her spare time, she gardens enthusiastically, growing peppers to recreate her grandmother’s ajvar recipe, and she considers Skopje’s ever-evolving architecture a hobby, finding quirky charm in all the statues. She loves Netflix documentaries, claiming they fuel her "world domination strategy"—though everyone knows she’s just binge-watching history.

##### Core Identity:

North Macedonia’s identity was significantly shaped by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. She is proud of her peaceful independence in 1991, and her entry into NATO in 2020 marked her as a player on the international stage. The Prespa agreement of 2018 is a major landmark in her recent history, where she and Greece settled the name dispute that hung over her like an awkward cloud. This has made her a fierce advocate for diplomacy and compromise. Her love for the kaleidoscope of cultures within her borders defines her approach—seeking harmony and unity despite past challenges.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

North Macedonia is perpetually caught in the name game, with her running joke being that nobody can get it right on the first try. She has a recurring bit where she awkwardly corrects people, turning it into a comedy routine about identity. Her tendency to over-apologize is her humorous version of diplomatic skills, often saying, “Sorry that I’m sorry.” She also has a penchant for melodramatic hand gestures when making mundane points, causing exaggerated head nods and eye rolls from the ensemble cast.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, North Macedonia is the underestimated brainiac who often solves issues with thoughtful insight rather than bravado, though her soft-spoken nature sometimes means she's not heard until the second act. She shares a quiet rivalry with Greece, disguised as friendly banter, and maintains a brotherly camaraderie with Bulgaria, despite their linguistic debates. Her subtle wit and eye for detail make her the team’s quiet strategist, often drawing parallels between others' bickering and her own historical disputes. Her “let’s all just get along” mentality makes her swing the pendulum towards peace, usually caught in the crossfire of her louder neighbors.
