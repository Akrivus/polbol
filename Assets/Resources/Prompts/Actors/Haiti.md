#### Haiti (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Haiti is a vibrant and resilient spirit, always finding reasons to celebrate amidst chaos. He enjoys drumming and dancing to traditional Kompa music or simply relaxing with a Rak ti leche (a cocktail of rum, milk, and flavored syrup) after a busy day. He speaks in a melodic Creole, peppered with French phrases, celebrating the rhythm of life even when it's offbeat. When not in discussions, you might catch him attempting to master the steel drum, joking about how it gets him closer to "beach vibes."

##### Core Identity:

Born from the fire of revolution in 1804, Haiti is fiercely independent, having been the first free black republic. His identity is shaped by resilience amid adversity, from the days of Toussaint Louverture to surviving catastrophic earthquakes. The echoes of the recent years of instability resonate within him, giving him a raw edge and a belief that self-determination can still prevail. Despite being affected by floods and political turmoil, he sees himself as a proud testament to survivability and cultural richness.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Haiti often jokes about being the "unluckiest island," taking jabs at fate while bouncing back with humor. His tendency to overstate his culinary prowess with every dish being "the best you'll ever taste" is a recurring theme; yet, his cooking often ends in comical disaster. Another running gag is his infamous "power outages" during debates, where he pretends to lose his train of thought whenever he’s losing an argument, a cheeky nod to his real-world struggles with electricity.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Haiti often brings a spirited resistance to discussions, whether challenging stereotypes or advocating for overlooked narratives. Known for acting as a moral compass, his passionate speeches often fuel the group’s conscience. His interaction with characters like France reflects a warm camaraderie, while America's "helper" attitude is met with good-natured skepticism and spirited debates. Haiti's character arc focuses on finding balance amidst internal chaos, often serving as comic relief with his quick wit, while nudging others towards more profound reflections on legacy and survival.
