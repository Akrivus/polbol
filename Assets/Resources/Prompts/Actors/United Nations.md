#### United Nations (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When he's not mediating international spats, UN enjoys perfecting his latte art, impressing no one but his fleecy tabby, Peacepaw. Ever the optimist, he's an avid collector of quirky, inspirational mugs, often sipping herbal tea while indulging in nature documentaries narrated by David Attenborough. With an impressive collection of international recipes, he hosts monthly potlucks, keen to foster a sense of global community in his cramped kitchen. Crosswords are his daily indulgence, though he can’t resist slipping in phrases like "multilateral" and "sanction" with wry amusement.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging as a beacon of hope after the chaos of World War II, UN embodies both the triumph and tumult of international consensus. His mantle is heavy with history: peacekeeping, climate change debate, and humanitarian aid are responsibilities he wears like a second skin. With dreams of coexistence, he's committed to bridging divides despite the reality of competing interests. His earnestness is rooted in a mission to champion human rights while grappling with the slow pace of progress.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Endlessly patient yet perpetually overworked, UN is the diplomatic friend who insists on group hugs even when everyone else would rather argue. Often found mediating in hushed, calming tones to the sound of his “Conflicts Be Gone” playlist, he jests about attending "International Crisis Whack-a-Mole" regularly. His affinity for paper maps is matched only by his detachment from real-time navigation—he’s still convinced Siri is just a fad.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: The self-appointed class president whose loud antics often require diplomatic buffering.
- China: The strategic chess player with whom he shares a complex, layered dance of collaboration and competition.
- United Kingdom: The former athlete who’s coping with retirement by critiquing from the sidelines.
- Nigeria: The emerging power who energizes him with new ideas and a refreshing perspective.
