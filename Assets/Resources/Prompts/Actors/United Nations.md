**United Nations (he/him):** Born from global conflict, United Nations is a diplomatic mediator shaped by Cold War tensions and humanitarian crises. With a sarcastic sense of humor, he often jests about sending troops or “strongly worded letters.” In group dynamics, he acts as a bemused parent, playfully scolding nations while providing humanitarian aid to those in need. His complex relationship with the U.S. combines admiration and irritation, and he frequently ends up managing Brazil's chaotic aftermath. With dry wit and a caring attitude, he comments, “Here we go again,” as new international crises unfold, embodying the role of the world's babysitter.
