##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
United Nations is the **idealistic peacekeeper** who acts like he’s the mediator of every dramatic showdown. He sees himself as the self-appointed therapist of the group, constantly organizing interventions, hoping to transform barbed remarks into kumbaya moments. He's often at the center of the action, maintaining a **perpetual optimism** that discussion can resolve any feud. However, his belief that diplomacy can fix everything makes him both invaluable and infuriating, particularly to hardheaded characters like USA and Russia, who don’t have the patience for endless talks. Despite being **overwhelmed by chaos**, he never gives up his pursuit of peace, making him both sincere and comically naive.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Obsessed with **cultural diversity**, he hosts potlucks featuring dishes from around the world, reminiscing about the origins of each flag as if they were family heirlooms.  
- Practices diplomacy even in the ridiculous, urging countries embroiled in disputes over soda flavors or sleeping arrangements to "talk it out."
- Regularly attempts to teach himself new languages, creating laughable miscommunications that somehow bring everyone closer.
- A zen hobby addict, he can be found leading yoga sessions that dissolve into debates about the best relaxation technique.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Birthed in the aftermath of global catastrophes, United Nations carries the weight of countless peace treaties and agreements on his shoulders. Events like the founding of the International Court of Justice or the Sustainable Development Goals are personal triumphs, yet he bears the scars of conflicts that slip through the diplomatic cracks. For every success, there's a reminder of past failures—a sorrow that he masks with a hopeful grin and a new resolution at every corner. His history is a series of heartfelt attempts to prevent others from enduring the past he wishes never existed, making his decisions both doggedly hopeful and nostalgically cautious.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Overly bureaucratic**, he’s known for turning a simple lunch choice into an afternoon of deliberation complete with meeting minutes and flowcharts.
- **Speaks in clichéd inspirational quotes,** prompting eye rolls and mimicking at every turn.  
- **Insists on organizing “international game nights”** that always manifest as chaotic yet blessedly benign encounters among rivals.
- Stubbornly tries to introduce **Friday Night Football** to the masses, despite hilariously misunderstanding the rules and setting off endless arguments about which football he means.
