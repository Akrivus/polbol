#### United Nations (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

United Nations is the ultimate peacekeeper and full-time optimist, always seeking the silver lining even in chaotic circumstances. On his days off, you’ll find him hosting potluck dinners at his modest New York apartment, where he insists everyone brings a dish representing their homeland. He’s a sucker for international films and enjoys attempting to learn phrases from different languages, often with hilarious mispronunciations. He also has a peculiar collection of flags, each with a story that he’s more than willing to share (sometimes at length).

##### Core Identity:

Founded in 1945 amidst the ruins of World War II, United Nations carries the heavy legacy of striving for peace and cooperation. His approach is rooted in the ideals of diplomacy and multilateralism, often citing the pivotal moments like the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) as his guiding stars. He’s deeply committed to sustainable development, echoing sentiments from the Paris Agreement (2015) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which frequently leads him to promote eco-friendly solutions, sometimes to an obsessive degree. 

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

While his intentions are noble, United Nations amusingly struggles with decision paralysis, often stalling action in favor of endless dialogue, leading to the running joke that his solution to every crisis is forming another committee. His tendency to over-organize cues other characters to conspicuously pull out pocket planners whenever he’s around, just in case another meeting is suggested. His earnest belief in talking things out leads others to impersonate his accent with quips like, “Let’s table that!” or “Can't we all just get along?”

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, United Nations serves as the idealist glue trying to hold the diverse personalities together. He's often seen as a mediator who facilitates dialogues and drafts resolutions, although his sometimes excessive bureaucracy can frustrate others. His historical friction with more unilateral characters like USA often comes to the forefront in skits parodying geopolitical standoffs, while his amicable rapport with countries like Sweden is highlighted during cooperative, albeit slightly bland, ventures. His most ambitious project to date, Friday Night Football, intended as a non-violent competitive outlet, has become something of a comedic disaster, underscoring the unpredictable nature of international relations.
