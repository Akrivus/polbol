#### United Nations (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
United Nations is the well-meaning but perpetually fatigued mediator who desperately tries to maintain harmony among his quirky coworkers. He's essentially the peacemaker-slash-bureaucrat trying to prevent the office from descending into chaos. Everyone sees him as the go-to diplomat who never gives up on fostering discussions, endlessly optimistic that dialogue can resolve even the most absurd office feuds—from coffee pot debates to disagreements on lunch orders. He’s the calming influence in the chaotic environment, often caught in the middle of volatile exchanges, especially between the intense personalities like USA and Russia. His presence is a mix of earnest sincerity and almost farcical idealism, creating a unique brand of humor as he navigates the absurdity of workplace "wars."

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Outside of heated debates, United Nations is a cultural connoisseur. He enjoys hosting diverse potlucks, charming everyone with tales of flag origins, and sharing his passion for international films. He loves learning new languages, though he often mangles phrases to comedic effect. Away from the desk, he indulges in peaceful hobbies, like origami or mediating yoga sessions, trying to practice the peace he preaches. His everyday struggle involves battling paperwork—mountains of forms he’s convinced are just another committee away from resolution.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
United Nations emerged from the ashes of World War II, carrying the solemn responsibility of preventing such calamity again. Historical milestones like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and commitments like the Paris Agreement deeply influence his mindset. Each historical lesson creates an opportunity for personal growth, nurturing his belief in inclusive dialogue and sustainable progress. Despite witnessing many setbacks, he approaches each situation with the hopeful resolve that multilateral effort can overcome global issues. His outlook blends vision, nostalgia, and the occasional disheartened sigh, particularly when past conflicts resurfaces as office squabbles.

- Strives to launch a peaceful competitive sport—Friday Night Football—which is both his brainchild and an ongoing mishap, reflecting the unpredictability of diplomacy.
