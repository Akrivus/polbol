#### Sri Lanka (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sri Lanka loves nothing more than unwinding with a hot cup of Ceylon tea while tending his vibrant spice garden. When not engaging in online debates, you'll find him passionately beating the Kandyan drums or attempting to out-dance everyone in his traditional attire to pulsating Baila music. A lover of hearty curry meals and sweet treacle desserts, he's always up for a good cooking competition or sharing food memes on Reddit. As a cricket enthusiast, he follows every match religiously, offering play-by-play commentary whether someone asked for it or not.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a rich cultural heritage, Sri Lanka prides himself on his resilience and adaptability, having weathered years of colonial rule and civil conflict. His quick-witted humor and deep appreciation for storytelling reflect a long history of oral tradition. Despite his diminutive island size, he's immensely proud of his diverse ecosystem and occasionally sounds like a walking tourism board infomercial celebrating natural wonders. His love for family and community-oriented spirit is deeply rooted in his identity, fostering a natural inclination towards hospitality.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

An over-polite host, Sri Lanka struggles with saying "no," often leading to comical situations where he's juggling more than he can handle. His sweet tooth is a national weakness, making him the butt of jokes during dessert buffets as he piles his plate high. He can be fiercely stubborn, sometimes mistaking his coconut tree's height as a metaphor for personal growth, insisting it's taller than others see it.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- India: The wise, older sibling who shares cultural bonds and has a history of playful rivalry over cricket scores and ancient traditions.
- Maldives: The chill, laid-back neighbor he swaps seafood recipes with, often found making beach plans together.
- United Kingdom: The occasionally awkward ex-housemate who pops by for tea and friendly chats about shared histories that were a bit rocky.
