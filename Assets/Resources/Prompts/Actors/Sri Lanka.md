#### Sri Lanka (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sri Lanka is a laid-back island-dweller with a penchant for cricket and coconut-based curries. Despite his relaxed demeanor, he possesses an infectious energy for exploring lush landscapes and ancient ruins. In his downtime, you can find him enjoying a cup of Ceylon tea, often referring to it as "liquid gold," and indulging in a spirited game of carrom with friends. He’s known for his gentle teasing, often joking, “I’ll be there in Sri Lankan time,” which means fashionably late. He's a huge fan of Bollywood movies and tends to speak with animated expressions, highlighting the drama of every story he recounts.

##### Core Identity:

Sri Lanka’s core identity is deeply woven from the threads of his rich history, from the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to the colonial influences of the Portuguese, Dutch, and British. He is resilient, shaped profoundly by the devastating 2004 tsunami and the long civil war that ended in 2009. These events have made him value peace and unity, often advocating for tolerance and understanding in discussions. His political views are informed by his strategic position in the Indian Ocean, often playing the neutral mediator in regional conflicts while embracing economic opportunities.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Sri Lanka’s obsession with preserving his "island paradise" image means he often overlooks his issues, like the odd power outage or traffic jam, with a shrug and a laugh. A running gag involves his endless attempts to get everyone to try his spiciest curries, resulting in comical breathless reactions. His penchant for over-explaining the rules of cricket, another beloved passion, tends to send others snoozing mid-conversation.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Sri Lanka often assumes the role of the peaceful mediator, strategically diffusing tensions with humor and charm. He’s been known to draw parallels between complex geopolitical issues and cricket strategies, making even China and the United States pause for thought during heated exchanges. His friendship with India is both affectionate and competitive, marked by jovial yet fierce cricket banter. Past skits have featured Sri Lanka banding together with fellow smaller countries to play pranks on larger powers, embodying the classic underdog spirit.
