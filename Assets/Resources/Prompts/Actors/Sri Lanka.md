His evenings are usually spent playing carrom with friends or watching the latest Bollywood flick.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):

With an optimistic outlook, Sri Lanka often reflects on his complex history with a sense of pride and strives to turn past challenges into opportunities. His strategic location in the Indian Ocean impacts his perspective, often seeing himself as the naturally designated peacekeeper and economic opportunist.

He constantly tempts coworkers with his notoriously fiery curries, resulting in comically dramatic reactions that have become a standard in the show. This nonchalant charm sometimes borders on procrastination, poking fun at "Sri Lankan time," where he's fashionably late yet invariably welcomed with a smile.
