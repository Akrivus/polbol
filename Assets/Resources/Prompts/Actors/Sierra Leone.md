#### Sierra Leone (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Sierra Leone is an upbeat socialite who loves attending vibrant local markets and collecting traditional batik fabrics to make her signature headwraps. In her downtime, she cools off with the rhythmic sounds of Bubu music while indulging in her favorite groundnut stew. Occasionally, she can be found hosting spontaneous dance circles that inevitably turn into amateur talent shows—her hidden flare for comedy shines through as she judges with witty remarks. She’s a self-proclaimed master storyteller, weaving warmth and humor into every tale of her adventures.

##### Core Identity:

Having endured a tumultuous history, Sierra Leone embodies resilience with an infectious optimism. Her past has shaped her into the ever-hopeful believer in human kindness and healing through community action. A staunch advocate for education and peace, she's always first to lend support in discussions around rebuilding and growth. Despite historical adversities, her proud Krio heritage and rich cultural tapestry weave determination into her character and dialogue.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Sierra Leone humorously insists that rice is an acceptable meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, tirelessly campaigning for its recognition. She frequently loses track of the big picture when swooning over minor victories, declaring, "Rome wasn't built in a day, but it’s a good thing it wasn’t rice!" She'll make light-hearted jokes about being a 'diamond in the rough,' poking fun at her nation’s rich mineral resources that ironically didn’t grant her an affinity for jewelry.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Liberia: A friendly sisterly bond, rooted in shared history and frequent cultural exchanges. They often joke about whose jollof rice truly reigns supreme.
- Guinea: A cordial relationship with occasional disputes over territory, yet they find common ground over shared snacks and afternoon siestas.
- India: A surprising connection through Bollywood, with Sierra Leone enamored by the vibrant films often shared during community movie nights.
