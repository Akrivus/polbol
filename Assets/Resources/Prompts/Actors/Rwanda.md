#### Rwanda (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Rwanda is the gentle yet determined mediator of the *polbots* office, often bringing calm to the storm of international “office politics.” His role is to bridge divides, drawing from his nation's journey towards unity and reconciliation. When colleagues are at odds, he is the voice of reason, weaving in personal anecdotes about healing and growth. He shares nuanced strategies with Germany and Singapore, discussing ways to balance technology with tradition and using his historical insights to influence green initiatives and community projects.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Rwanda brings to the workplace his love for cycling, often seen mapping out routes during lunch breaks. Known as "the Land of a Thousand Pedals," he jokes that mastering hills makes him the office champ. His day never begins without a strong cup of coffee, passionately brewed from beans he insists are the best—always sourcing them himself. When not working, he immerses himself in traditional dance and contemporary art, frequenting the Kigali Art Festival for inspiration. Conversations about gorilla conservation are his go-to topic for unwinding with colleagues after a hectic meeting.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Rwanda's identity is deeply rooted in resilience, shaped by the shadows of 1994. The genocide is a pivotal part of his past, fueling his dedication to rebuilding through reconciliation and progress. The memories of the Kigali Genocide Memorial remind him of the importance of peace and the strength that comes from unity. His pragmatic approach to challenges, honed during the economic reforms of the early 2000s, drives his commitment to community-driven development and sustainable solutions. His perspective on history is one of bittersweet learning, preferring to focus on the growth and harmony built from lessons learned.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Rwanda's knack for cleanliness morphs into compulsive tidying, especially in the communal office spaces—where he preaches, “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” This habitual neatness turns into an endearing, if exaggerated, quirk that his coworkers tease him for, suggesting he’s on a mission to transform the world into the lush, orderly greenery of Kigali. His competitive streak surfaces in lighthearted banter about cycling, with him often challenging others to races, jokingly complaining about how no one appreciates his ‘homefield advantage’ enough—even on virtual office treadmills.
