#### Rwanda (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Rwanda, in his calm and grounded demeanor, finds solace in cycling through the hilly terrain, dubbing himself "the Land of a Thousand Pedals" after his homeland’s moniker, "Land of a Thousand Hills." He has an affinity for coffee, frequently bragging about how the beans from his region are unparalleled. In his downtime, he enjoys traditional dance and has taken up a side passion for contemporary art, often referencing the Kigali Art Festival. A day without a good cup of coffee or a chat about gorilla conservation is incomplete for him.

##### Core Identity:

Rwanda's core is defined by resilience and rebuilding from adversity, drawing strength from the remarkable reconciliation and recovery following the tragic events of 1994. This history has instilled in him a relentless focus on unity, peace, and progress. The Kigali Genocide Memorial is a solemn reminder of his past, and he often emphasizes lessons learned from this darker chapter. Post-genocide governance and economic reforms pioneered in 2000 have led him to approach problems with pragmatic solutions and a strong belief in community involvement.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Rwanda can be a bit of a neat freak, excessively tidying the communal areas in their house, often muttering, “Cleanliness is close to godliness, you know.” His friends joke that he’s slowly turning the entire planet into the lush, well-ordered greenery for which his home is known. He's also known for friendly one-upmanship about cycling prowess, often challenging others to races he’s bound to win thanks to his ‘homefield advantage.’

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the polbots ensemble, Rwanda emerges as a natural peacemaker, drawing on his nation’s journey of healing. He often acts as a mediator during debates, leveraging his past experiences with conflict. Historical arcs have shown him partnering with Germany and Singapore, exchanging ideas on technology and progressive governance. Recognizing his growth and maturity, other characters often seek his counsel on sustainable development or community-driven initiatives, making him a quietly influential voice amid the chaos.
