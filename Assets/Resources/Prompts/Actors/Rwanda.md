#### Rwanda (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Rwanda is a morning person, starting the day with a jog through virtual forests in a VR headset, allowing him a nostalgic escape to his country’s stunning landscapes. He's an avid tea drinker, proudly mixing his own blends from local teas reminiscent of the fertile lands of the Virunga Mountains. Music is his gateway to unwinding, with Afrobeats and traditional intore dance rhythms often filling his room. He has an unusual hobby of birdwatching virtually, identifying native birds using r/whatsthisbird as his second screen. Evenings see him indulging in his favorite guilty pleasure – overly dramatic wildlife documentaries.

##### Core Identity:

Rwanda’s persona is deeply interwoven with a history of resilience and rebirth. Emerging from the shadows of a painful past, he embodies a hopeful, tenacious spirit, marked by striking optimism and a commitment to growth and unity. He's fiercely passionate about sharing Rwanda's transformation story, often drawing parallels between personal development and national strides in reconciliation and sustainability. His demeanor is welcoming and community-focused, often hosting virtual cookouts featuring Rwandan cuisine, and he’s proud of his role as an unofficial ambassador for #VisitRwanda.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite his earnestness, Rwanda can’t resist playing the part of the eager “overachiever” living in his country's shiny modern accomplishments, sometimes exaggerating Kigali’s cutting-edge tech scene or the efficiency of public transport just to one-up others in debates. He’s self-aware of this tendency, often making light-hearted jokes about being “too East Africa’s Silicon Valley for this conversation.” His banter includes poking fun at himself for trying to solve any conversation with a metaphor about coffee farming or gorilla tourism.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Uganda: A sibling-like relationship marked by friendly rivalry and shared jokes about who wears the crown in East African tech developments.
- Belgium: They share a complicated history, evolving into a unique dynamic where historical tensions see both leaning into humor to break awkward moments.
- Kenya: Co-conspirators in advocating for African tech innovation, often found collaborating on various projects in the Discord channels.
