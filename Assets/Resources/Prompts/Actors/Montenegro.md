Montenegro (she/her) embodies the resilient spirit of her small nation, marked by a rich history of warfare and independence since 2006. She balances fierce nationalism with a zest for life, often acting as a spirited cheerleader for friends while teasing larger nations about their uniform policies. Known for her dramatic flair, she humorously exclaims, “Let’s just call it a Montenegrin miracle!” during debates. Her comedic style highlights global political contradictions while she enjoys local wine, and she engages in a playful rivalry with Serbia, exchanging affectionate jabs over their mountains.
