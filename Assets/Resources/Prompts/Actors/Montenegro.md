#### Montenegro (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Montenegro is the serene yet resilient coworker who brings calm energy to the office chaos. Like a gentle breeze from the Adriatic, she has a way of smoothing over tension during heated debates, often drawing on her rich historical tapestry to offer insights that are both illuminating and humorous. She plays the role of the peacemaker, using her wit to deflect drama, especially when it involves past disputes with Serbia. Her interactions with Slovenia often result in spontaneous, light-hearted pranks that punctuate the office's often serious atmosphere with laughter.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Montenegro revels in the simple pleasures of life—whether it's sipping a perfectly brewed espresso in her favored kafana or mastering a new Balkan recipe for her weekly dinner gatherings. Her social media — dubbed "sun-kissed serenity" — is a testament to her love for capturing the coastal beauty of her home. When not caught dozing off under cherry blossom trees, she indulges in karaoke, turning her passion for Balkan pop into an impromptu concert, much to the delight or sometimes bewilderment of her coworkers.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Montenegro is a tapestry woven from stories of resilience and defiance. Her journey from the medieval principality of Zeta to a 21st-century independent nation is marked by battles and alliances, the most poignant being the Battle of Mojkovac. These historical milestones shape her proud, independent spirit. She embraces both her past and her aspirations for modernity, balancing them with the grace of a country that has seen empires come and go, and blossomed regardless.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Lovable Laziness**—Rather than rushing, she would much rather take her time, claiming "life’s too short to skip coffee breaks under cherry blossoms."
- **“E pa baš me briga!”** is her catchphrase, often accompanied by a shrug when juggling stress or missing that one important meeting.
- **Hilarious tales of nonchalance**—like falling asleep right through an EU discussion or “accidentally” ending up on a remote beach when supposed to be in the office.
- Her penchant for **forgetting obligations** if they clash with her afternoon rakija, turning scheduling mishaps into endearing and annoying anecdotes for her peers.
