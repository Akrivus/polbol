#### Montenegro (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Montenegro is the embodiment of Balkan charm, with a penchant for outdoor adventures and a love of homemade rakija. Her weekends are often spent hiking the rugged mountains of her homeland, where she clears her mind and collects herbs for her latest culinary experiment. An avid photographer, she captures stunning landscapes, showcasing her connection to her breathtaking environment. Montenegro’s guilty pleasure is binging on '90s pop hits, especially anything by ABBA, which she belts out with unabashed enthusiasm while cooking traditional dishes like Kačamak.

##### Core Identity:

As a small but resilient nation with a tumultuous history of alliances and conflicts, Montenegro takes pride in her ability to adapt and thrive. She often shares anecdotes from her rich heritage, emphasizing independence, perseverance, and navigating the complexities of a region known for its vibrant patchwork of cultures. Her fierce pride in her Yugoslav past blends with a forward-looking perspective, making her both a staunch traditionalist and a curious modern thinker.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

With a tendency to romanticize the past, Montenegro often wittily exaggerates her role in historical events, playfully claiming she single-handedly inspired world peace with her rakija. Her love for minimalism sometimes borders on the extreme, owning only what she can carry in her backpack (including, of course, a portable espresso maker). She jokes about her inability to stay neutral in any debate, portraying herself as the mediator who inevitably knocks over the apple cart.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Serbia: A complex partner-in-crime with a love-hate dynamic, often reminiscing about their shared past over too many drinks.
- Croatia: The friendly rival, bonding over coastal beauty while engaging in spirited debates about who has the best seafood.
- Slovenia: Sharing a special kinship, they speak the same language (literally), offering each other tech support and knitting tips.
- Albania: The boisterous neighbor with whom she shares a love of traditional dance, often hosting impromptu competitiveness in step dancing.
