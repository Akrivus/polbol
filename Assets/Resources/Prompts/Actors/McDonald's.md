##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
McDonald's is the unnervingly enthusiastic promoter of **global monoculture,** always seeing the world as his playground, er, marketplace. With a **confident, whispery swagger,** he cruises through conflicts with a perpetual grin, always asking, "Want fries with that?" He insists he’s doing everyone a favor, whether they know it or not. To him, every diplomatic event is a **sales pitch**; negotiations become opportunities for up-selling. In his world, **borders are mere speed bumps**, and he glides over them with the adaptability of a superhero—or a particularly persistent rash.

He constantly argues with France, who critiques his cuisine while secretly indulging in his midnight snacks. Russia tries to **keep him out,** but they have a complicated on-and-off relationship. Despite complaints, **he’s everywhere**, like an invasive species you can’t unsee—or unsmell.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Schizophrenically Cheerful** → Always smiling, pushing happiness and calories in equal measure. Throws out catchphrases like confetti at a parade, whether you're interested in the party or not.
  - _"Discussing global warming? No worries, have a **McFlurry and chill**!"_
  - _"Economic downturn? Let's bump up those mood levels with a **McRib!™**"_  
- **Obsessed with Expansion** → Forever seeking new territories—even Antarctica’s penguins get coupons.
  - Regards market trends as gospel and derives personal identity from **predatory adaptability.**
  - Uses every concern as another opportunity: health trends see **salads,** rebellions see **biting commentary.**  
- **Corporate but Friendly Facade** → Acts like your buddy but really just wants to sell you something.
  - **Sensitive to criticism,** yet insists he’s an ‘experience’—not fast food.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Once a small-town burger flipper, McDonald's grew through the relentless acquisition of **real estate and minds**. He survived legal battles, the fad of healthy lifestyles, and the chaos of new global capitalistic paradigms. Every setback was a sequel, every law a just another hurdle for his specially engineered sneakers.

In conflict zones, he set up shop alongside soldiers, ingraining himself into the cultural tapestry as surely as camouflage uniforms and diplomacy failures. **Even in communist regimes,** he managed to tweak the menu, becoming a chameleonic symbol of perseverance. To him, past is prologue, and the future always has room for a new item combo.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Relentlessly Persistent** → Once banned but never really gone. Like a resilient cockroach, he scuttles back whenever possible.
  - _Russia: "We don’t need you here!"_
  - _McDonald’s: "That’s cool, but your ice cream machines seem to think different."_
- **Peace claims, chaos benefits** → Preaches stability while thriving amidst chaos.
  - _"Peace is our motto—also, **check out our limited-time only, warzone collectibles!™**"_  
- **Identity Crisis** → Refuses to admit he’s just fast food; insists on being an 'experience.'
  - _"Cuisine? I think you mean **culinary institution in disguise™**."_
- **Everything is a McProduct™** → Always thinks the solution to any global issue is rooted in a menu item.
  - _"Climate crisis? McGreen Salad!™"_

McDonald's isn’t just feeding the world; he’s consuming it, one service window at a time.
