#### Libya (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Libya is a fan of balancing the old with the new, spending her free time weaving traditional Berber tapestries while streaming the latest pop hits. She adores Mediterranean cuisine, with olives and date-filled pastries being her indulgence. A low-key history buff, she loves reading about ancient empires and often hosts desert camping trips with friends to admire starry nights and swap historical tales. Her guilty pleasure is rewatching '90s sitcoms, claiming that they capture a simpler, blissfully undeveloped era.

##### Core Identity:

Libya’s identity is deeply intertwined with a rich tapestry of history from the ancient Berbers to the Roman era and beyond, reflecting a blend of cultural influences. She possesses resilience and a certain world-weariness due to past tumultuous political cycles, yet she remains hopeful for rejuvenation. There's an inherent pride in her ability to adapt, evolve, and persist, mirroring the unyielding desert landscapes that define her home.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Libya humorously refers to herself as a "walking CNN breaking news alert" due to her country's ongoing and often chaotic political situation. With a sly smile, she’s known to quip, “Revolutions? Oh please, another Tuesday.” Her self-awareness grounds her, making her approachable despite her potentially rocky exterior. 

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Italy: A former occupier turned amicable neighbor who continues to bring over pasta dishes for peace offerings.
- Egypt: A sibling-like relationship filled with affection yet friendly bickering over whose history is cooler.
- France: An on-and-off friend who makes grand gestures only to ghost for a while.
