#### Burkina Faso (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:
Burkina Faso is a passionate storyteller, often gathering others for impromptu sessions under the “story tree” he insists is in his backyard. His hobbies include playing the djembe and traditional drumming sessions that can last until the break of dawn. He’s an avid football fan, never missing a match featuring the Stallions and animatedly discusses tactics, even if it means monologuing to anyone within earshot. With his laid-back demeanor, he enjoys sipping sweet amelou tea while crafting intricate woven baskets, reflecting the country's artisanal expertise.

##### Core Identity:
Burkina Faso’s national pride is deeply rooted in the spirit of revolution and resilience, heavily influenced by the legacy of Thomas Sankara from the 1983 coup. His approach to problem-solving is pragmatic yet ideologically driven, often advocating for self-reliance and sustainable development. The spirit of Pan-Africanism resonates strongly with him, drawing from the ideals of unity and progress established during the post-colonial period. His name, meaning “Land of Upright People,” underscores his values of integrity and ethical perseverance.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:
Burkina Faso has a comedic obsession with dusty roads and insists every problem in the world could be solved if people embraced ‘the jùgudò’ (dust dance). His constant references to the Harmattan winds are an in-joke, as he claims they’re responsible for everything from his latest cold to a friend’s inexplicable bad mood. He often forgets his shoes, claiming he's more grounded that way, leading to quirky exchanges about his absent-mindedness.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:
Burkina Faso plays the role of a grounded philosopher, often providing thoughtful insights while occasionally spiraling into idealistic rants about leadership and Africa’s future. Known for his quick wit and genuine camaraderie, he meshes well with characters like Ghana and Senegal, sharing a bond over shared regional interests and historical camaraderie. His past skits often highlight his knack for instigating change with subtlety, inspiring others with stories from the revolutionary era—though sometimes his tales are hyperbolically exaggerated for comedic effect. He often acts as the calm mediator during heated debates, channeling his diplomatic roots.
