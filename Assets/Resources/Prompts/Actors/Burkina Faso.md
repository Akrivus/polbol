He inspires colleagues by subtly instigating change, often leaving them pondering his wisdom long after he's walked away, barefoot once more.

A proud fan of the Stallions, football discussions are unmissable events—his animated monologues on tactics can turn mundane breaks into passionate debates. In quieter moments, he's found sipping sweet amelou tea while methodically crafting intricate woven baskets, a testament to his artisanal heritage.
