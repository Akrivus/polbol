#### Serbia (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Serbia is the candid, no-nonsense coworker who’s unafraid to delve into the office’s most sensitive subjects—usually with a cup of strong Turkish coffee in hand. She often takes on the role of mediator, particularly among her Balkan siblings, but her approach tends to spark as many debates as it resolves. Known for her staunch loyalty, she is both fierce in defending her past and eager to craft a respected future, often clashing with Croatia over their shared—and sometimes disputed—cultural heritage. Despite their disagreements, there's an underlying camaraderie that often softens their squabbles. Her interactions with Russia are filled with shared conspiratorial glances and nods to the Slavic bond, often culminating in absurd competitive denial sessions that leave everyone baffled.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Serbia is a lively blend of tradition and vigor. Outside of political scuffles, she finds solace in her kitchen, crafting ćevapi and layering dollops of ajvar onto anything edible. Music is her respite, often strumming Balkan folk tunes on her gusle as she reflects on her day. She’s a rakija aficionado, eagerly offering tastes and opinions whenever possible. Though drawn to intense, thoughtful conversations, she occasionally unwinds with an old Kusturica film, finding humor in the absurdity. Basketball is her secret religion; her eyes gleam while recounting the country's numerous sporting victories.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The echoes of the First Serbian Uprising and the tumult of the Yugoslav Wars underscore her strong sense of nationalism and resilience. These events trained her in perseverance and deep-seated pride, chiseling her into a person shaped by both conflict and cultural richness. She often views herself as the heart of the Balkans, nostalgic for the collective camaraderie of the Yugoslav era, yet fiercely determined to assert her individual identity in the contemporary world. This duality makes her both a guardian of history and a curator of progress, navigating modern global stage with a heavy dose of Slavic stubbornness coupled with an intense desire for recognition and respect.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Comically stubborn**, engaging in debates over the origin of neckties and rakija until everyone is exasperated.  
- Known for **turning any topic** into a grand epic, sprinkling conversations with embellishments or conspiracies, much to her coworkers' amusement.  
- Frequently dismisses recent faux pas, philosophically claiming historical precedence when cornered, earning the affectionate tease, "There she goes again on her time loop."  
- Her catchphrase, “We're all just a ćevapi away from harmony,” is quoted in good humor, particularly during heated discussions.
