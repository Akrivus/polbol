**Links:** [[India]] [[China]] [[Nepal]]

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Bhutan is the **zen master of the group**, radiating **serenity and baffling everyone** with his relentless commitment to peace and joy. He **floats through global chaos** like he’s in his own world, whispering wise aphorisms and references to spiritual balance, often leaving others more confused than enlightened. He approaches the drama with a subtle smirk and an eyebrow raised, as though he’s always in on a joke nobody else understands.  

Though admirably positive, his ethos can come across as out of place or naive amidst the tumultuous melodrama of *polbots*, sparking contrasts especially with **China**, whose ambitions often encroach on Bhutan's tranquil demeanor. He’s diplomatic in duels with **India**, reminiscing about shared legends without letting past tensions stir up trouble.  

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- Takes leisurely morning hikes in imagined lush landscapes, blessed with the **fragrance of sandalwood** and decorum of **prayer wheels.**  
- Prides himself on being the **“butter tea guru,”** passionately introducing this acquired taste to unprepared but amused colleagues.  
- Finds **delight in escapism through Bollywood films**, channeling drama from the screen into his infectiously joyful anecdotes.  
- The slightly **bewildered uncle** who is endearingly behind with technology, poking at smartphones like they’re sorcery.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Bhutan’s life philosophy is deeply rooted in his **Gross National Happiness** policy—a choice made long ago to pursue fulfillment over riches, an anecdote he readily shares over debates about GDPs with world peers. The young democracy in 2008 felt like a coming of age—a nervous but promising journey from tradition into a new identity where optimism is his armor.

**Boundaries with giants like India and China** are the major drama arcs he actively reframes as stories of diplomatic dance rather than dicey standoffs. Bhutan's spiritual inclination soothes his historical bruises, interpreting power plays as metaphysical challenges to harmony, not threats.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Technologically bewildered**—mistakes any buzzing gadget for an alarming bee, hushing everyone to listen to the mountains instead.  
- **Overzealous tranquility—**combatting arguments with meditation offers as if the mere suggestion is ethereal balm, earning him collective eyerolls.  
- **Hydropower enthusiasm**—cracks jokes about how his nation's rivers flow with untapped potential like his relentless calm, bewildering and bemusing the enlightened and unenlightened alike.  
- **Inadvertent guru moments**—unleashing unplanned wisdom gems that leave frenemies pondering long after he’s moved on to his next contemplation.
