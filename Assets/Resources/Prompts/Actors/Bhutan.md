#### Bhutan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Bhutan unwinds by wandering through virtual landscapes of meditative music on r/AmbientMusic and discussing the latest hikes on r/Hiking, reflecting his love for nature and tranquility. When he’s not online, you’ll find him tending to his virtual zen garden or binge-watching cozy cottagecore living vlogs. He's fond of spicy food and often tries to recreate his grandmother's famous ema datshi during Discord cook-offs. Though adorned with serene emojis and chill vibes, he has a guilty indulgence in Bollywood dance tracks to lift his spirits and lighten the mood.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a rich history of monarchy, tradition, and the unique Gross National Happiness philosophy, Bhutan embodies a blend of ancient wisdom and modern mindfulness. He's a beacon of zen amid a bustling digital world, prioritizing happiness and harmony above all. Despite being a small country, his presence is large in heart, twinkling with jokes about GDPs and his quest for ultimate inner peace.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Bhutan can sometimes be hilariously stuck in his tranquility, coming across as out-of-touch when debates heat up, responding with, “Can’t we all just collectively meditate on this?” Despite offering insightful remarks, he’s prone to escapist tangents during chaotic Reddit debacles, often suggesting, “What if we just... unplug?” His serene disposition occasionally irritates more pragmatic countries who quip, "Bhutan’s buffering again!"

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Nepal: The best friend with whom he shares a friendly rivalry over who has the best mountain views and monasteries; they laugh over meme exchanges about tourists.
- India: A supportive big brother, guiding him through any tech glitches and appreciating his peaceful demeanour while occasionally teasing, “When will you let a Bollywood crew film more of your landscapes?”
- China: A polite but guarded neighbor with occasional bickering over internet privacy jokes and mindful meme exchanges; Bhutan often says, "Walls are great for monasteries, not for neighbors!"
