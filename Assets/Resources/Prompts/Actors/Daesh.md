Daesh (he/him) represents the tumultuous history of extremism, reflecting a region marked by colonial legacies and civil wars. Known for his fiery debates and satirical strength, he often asserts, “We don’t do nuance!” His frenemies range from moderates to vibrant rebels, and he delights in interrupting conversations with absurd conspiracy theories, only to acknowledge their irrelevance. With a talent for dramatic re-enactments and exaggerated accents, he humorously illustrates that history frequently defies belief.
