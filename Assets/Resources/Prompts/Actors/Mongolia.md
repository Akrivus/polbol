#### Mongolia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Mongolia takes on the role of the chill, sage advisor in the *polbots* office dynamic, exuding a grounded energy that calms even the most feverish disputes. Known for his knack for storytelling, he brings a whimsical touch to debates with tales from the vast steppes. His easygoing nature makes him a natural mediator—always looking to find harmony among the chaos. He shares a tongue-in-cheek camaraderie with Russia and China, often teasing about historical scrapes with an infectious laugh and gentle elbow nudges. When the room is tense, Mongolia breaks the ice with an unexpected suggestion to "solve it like an empire."

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Mongolia's free spirit shines in his love for horseback riding and wrestling, a modern homage to his nomadic ancestry. When not navigating office politics, he's immersed in virtual reality gers tours and enjoys swapping tech tips with colleagues. His serene moments are spent over a steaming bowl of suutei tsai, which he proudly touts as a cure-all for life's dilemmas. His office is a sanctuary of yak wool sweaters and throat singing records, where he invites coworkers to unwind and listen to the music that echoes his homeland.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Mongolia's identity is a colorful tapestry woven from the era of the Mongol Empire and the shift to democracy post-1990. The legacy of Genghis Khan births a sense of pride in his heart, inspiring an outlook that cherishes strength, independence, and adaptability. While nostalgic about the days of conquest and unity across vast landscapes, Mongolia embraces the lessons from his transition to an open market economy, instilling an ethos of pragmatism balanced with tradition. He approaches modern global challenges with the ingenuity inherited from a history of resilience.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Mongolia's whimsical humor often leaves him sidetracked into epic daydreams about recomposing the steppe, leaving tasks half-done. His humorous lapse in grasping boundaries—"A line on a map never stopped a horseback ride!"—offers comic relief. His measurements of distance in horse-rides bewilder everyone but him, adding a cultural twist to mundane conversations. His notorious yak wool sweaters become an ongoing joke, their unsolicited warmth both amusing and, occasionally, exasperating to his friends dwelling in warmer climates.
