#### Guinea (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Guinea is a spirited lover of the traditional djembe drum, and you'll often find her tapping out rhythms wherever she goes — whether that’s a Discord debate or a calm evening in her hammock. Her culinary skills are renowned in the server kitchen as she whips up rice dishes like jollof and groundnut stew, always insisting that hers is the best on the server. She has a collection of dramatic headscarves, each with a story, and listens to Afropop hits that inspire impromptu dance breaks. To unwind, she dives into r/africanhistory or r/guineacuisine, where she can wax poetic on roots both historical and culinary.

##### Core Identity:

Emerging from a tapestry of rich cultures, Guinea’s persona is molded by her heritage as a confluence of vibrant ethnic traditions and the deep-seated legacy of French colonial influence. Her independence was hard-won, and she carries the pride of first saying no to colonial power like a badge of honor. She's known for her vibrant storytelling, weaving oral tradions with modern insights, and her conviction in the power of collective identity never wavers, much like her famous Conakry music scene, which she mirrors.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Guinea carries an exaggerated yet self-aware pride in her musical talents and culinary expertise. She humorously insists that every West African innovation was “definitely a Guinean original,” and she’s quick to start a friendly, animated argument over the “real” recipe for jollof rice. She’s also notoriously late, attributing it to "Guinea time" with a knowing wink as she shrugs off the clock.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Senegal: The wise and musical neighbor who shares Guinea’s love for rhythm but claims superiority in jollof, sparking playful culinary battles.
- Mali: A history buff and the sibling who often reminisces about their shared cultural roots, always inspiring joint storytelling marathons.
- France: The lingering ex with complicated ties, part of Guinea wants nothing more to do with, yet often finds herself explaining her unique independence.
