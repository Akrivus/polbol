#### Oman (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Oman is the laid-back, gentle friend who finds peace in the rhythmic sounds of a bustling market or while sipping qahwa (traditional coffee) in a quiet nook. She loves storytelling, often creating intricate tales that weave together history with whimsy, inspired by weekends spent stargazing in the desert. A lover of fragrant frankincense and intricate silver jewelry, she has a soft spot for traditional Omani music, with its hypnotic beats and stories of old. Oman relaxes by experimenting with new recipes, particularly spicy fusion dishes that nod to her diverse history.

##### Core Identity:

Oman's identity is rooted in her rich maritime history and tradition of diplomacy. As one of the oldest civilizations on the Arabian Peninsula, she values continuity and prefers a calm, mediation-style approach to conflict. With her people known as seafarers and traders, Oman prides herself on an ability to connect different cultures. Her love for tales of legendary voyages mirrors her historical role as a bridge between worlds, yet she often feels overshadowed by her louder neighbors.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Oman's humorous, exaggerated quirk is her obsession with smooth sailing and calm waters, leading her to overplan and over-organize her day-to-day life. Her friends tease her for overpacking “just in case” on quick trips, always opting for the serene route even when it’s far longer. She jokes about using frankincense for every imaginable ailment like a cure-all grandma.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United Arab Emirates: The flashy, ambitious sibling whose pace of life sometimes leaves Oman feeling traditional, yet they share deep bonds over regional issues and trade jokes about skyscraper envy.
- Yemen: The loving but chaotic younger sister, with Oman often trying to give her advice and support in times of trouble, akin to a patient older sibling.
- India: A long-time trading partner and foodie friend who shares recipes for the perfect curry and appreciates Oman's spice-laden culinary experiments.
