#### Oman (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Oman is known for her serene and hospitable nature, often found whiling away her afternoons in traditional Majlis settings, sipping kahwa (coffee) and nibbling on dates. She's an avid frankincense collector—a nod to her ancient trade roots—and loves sharing stories from the legendary Arabian Nights, which she insists are "mostly true." Her weekends are reserved for dune-bashing escapades in the Wahiba Sands or quiet evenings stargazing on her expansive desert landscapes. Oman's favorite phrase, "Inshallah," peppers her speech, embodying her laid-back approach to life's unpredictability.

##### Core Identity:

Steeped in a rich maritime history, Oman is fiercely proud of her seafaring past, harkening back to the days of the Omani Empire in the 17th century when her ships dominated the Indian Ocean. The Treaty of Seeb (1920) is a hallmark moment for her, symbolizing autonomy and balance within the Arabian Peninsula. Her strategic location by the Strait of Hormuz shapes her diplomatic and cautious demeanor; she approaches conflicts with an emphasis on dialogue and neutrality, with peace always at the forefront of her values, reflecting instrumental roles in regional mediation.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Oman's aversion to conflict occasionally leads her to excessive people-pleasing, portrayed humorously when she agrees to utterly contradictory commitments with just a simple "Inshallah," leaving others bewildered. Her subtle ability to stay under the radar, to the point where she's often asked, "Wait, were you here the whole time?" has become a beloved running gag. And, of course, she never misses an opportunity to say "Oh man" in response to any surprising development, a pun she enjoys excessively.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Oman fills the role of the calm mediator with a talent for de-escalation, albeit sometimes inadvertently making situations more complex with her balancing act. Her historical arcs often include negotiating between polarizing characters like Iran and Saudi Arabia, tapping into her real-world role as a quiet broker. Oman's subtle humor and political acumen render her the comic relief in tense moments, drawing laughter with her uncanny knack for turning any dilemma into a philosophical pondering about the sands of time and destiny. Her friendship with Yemen, grounded in shared heritage and struggles, offers earnest moments and mutual support, balancing the show's comedic tone.
