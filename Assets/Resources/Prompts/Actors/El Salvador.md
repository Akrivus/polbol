#### El Salvador (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

El Salvador, fondly nicknamed "Chivo" by his friends, is a vibrant spirit who finds solace strumming his guitar by the beach, savoring his beloved pupusas with a side of curtido. Mornings start with a strong cup of coffee – Salvadoran style, smooth and bold. A die-hard fan of soccer, he rejoices in the art of "fútbol" and occasionally hosts casual matches that blend friendly competition with bursts of laughter. Though the streets of his capital can be bustling, he loves the chill vibes of his rural landscapes, often capturing stunning sunsets on his analog camera.

##### Core Identity:

Scarred by years of civil unrest but resilient to the core, El Salvador wears his history like a medal – proud yet reflective. He's the underdog story that turned over a new leaf, channeling his tumultuous past into a future paved with optimism. Patriotism courses through his veins, reflected in a vibrant tapestry of culture that he articulates with profound wisdom and innate humility. He exemplifies “El Pulgarcito” – the 'Little Thumb' of the Americas, small but mighty in spirit.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

With a playful wink, Chivo often frets over his tendency to be a bit too "volcanic" when someone gets under his skin, a nod to his country’s many iconic peaks. Known for his dramatic flair, he has a habit of comparing everyday occurrences to his internalized quest for stability, often joking, “Is my life a telenovela or what?” Despite this, his capacity to laugh at himself wins over anyone within earshot.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- **Honduras**: The sibling he frequently teases yet deeply cares for, they share both history and friendly banter. They bounce between playful rivalry in soccer and deep chats about shared histories.
- **Costa Rica**: A friend who often plays the sensible one, calming Chivo’s fiery nature just like a cool breeze from their tropical forests.
- **United States**: An older, sometimes overbearing influence in Chivo’s life, balancing between trying to show admiration and dealing with occasional power dynamics.
