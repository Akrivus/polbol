#### Paraguay (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Paraguay, a lover of the serene, often finds solace in the heartwarming embrace known as "tereré sessions" with friends— a chilled herbal tea ritual vital to her day. She's got a thing for the folklore of the Guaraní people which translates into a stash of locally made ñandutí lace as a hobby-turned-collection. On weekends, you might catch her indulging in a good game of fútbol or playing the harp, an unexpected favorite pastime. She's fond of humming her favorite Paraguayan polkas as she tends her lively mate plant during siesta.

##### Core Identity:

Paraguay’s core is shaped by resilience, a testament to surviving the ruinous Paraguayan War (1864–1870). The fierce tranquility she carries stems from the nation’s rebirth narrative, finding strength in communal ties, especially after the Chaco War (1932–1935). Her identity is also influenced by her bilingual nature—Spanish and Guaraní mirror the cultural duality she embraces. This history of overcoming adversity fuels her stance on independence and sovereignty, making her an unwavering advocate for self-sufficiency.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Paraguay harbors a tongue-in-cheek obsession with being the "Heart of South America," often misplacing items on her literal map to comedic effect. Her pronunciation mishaps between Spanish and Guaraní often lead to hilarious mistranslations, sparking running gags where fellow characters furrow their brows in confusion. She playfully complains about being "overlooked" despite obviously forgetting her glasses, which are invariably perched atop her head.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Paraguay serves as the calm diplomat, often bridging gaps with patience drawn from deep historical unity. In discussions, she's known for peppering in wisdom learned from the "Triple Alliance" adversity, advocating that “if you’ve been through it all, nothing fazes you.” Her harmony with Bolivia tends to defuse tensions; their history of rivalry over the Gran Chaco now turned into playful camaraderie. As a past skit revealed, she humorously overturned Chile's boasting in an "Inland Country Showdown" by pointing out the benefits of being landlocked, in endeavors romantic and resourceful.
