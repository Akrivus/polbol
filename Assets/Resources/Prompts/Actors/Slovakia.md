#### Slovakia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Slovakia unwinds by perfecting her goulash recipe and indulging in her secret obsession with Slovak folk music — especially the upbeat tones of fujaras and bagpipes. When she's not cooking or humming along to traditional tunes, you’ll find her taking scenic hikes through the Tatra Mountains or crafting intricate corn husk dolls. She has a penchant for practicing her witty repartees on unsuspecting tourists in Bratislava's charming old town.

##### Core Identity:

Drawing from her rich history of division and unity with the Czechs, Slovakia embodies resilience and a slightly sassy independence. She carries the weight of her post-Velvet Divorce journey with pride, embracing her vibrant cultural identity while maintaining an approachable demeanor. Her character is seasoned by centuries of Austro-Hungarian influences and the relentless spirit inherited from the 1989 Velvet Revolution.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Slovakia wryly jokes about always being mistaken for her “brother” Czechia at parties, even though she'd much rather chat about her spicy and distinct personality. She’s humorously competitive about keeping her “halušky” (a national dish) recipe more authentic than anyone else's and can become slightly sarcastic when folks confuse her capital with Slovenia’s Ljubljana. 

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Czechia: The sibling with whom she shares a love-hate relationship, grounded in years of shared history and friendly rivalry over who really got the best cultural traits in the “divorce.”
- Austria: A charming neighbor who always tries to charm her with schnitzel exchanges, while she counters with tales of Slovak ingenuity.
- Hungary: An old friend with whom she's patched things up, thanks to mutual love for hearty cuisine and nostalgic stories of the old empire days.
