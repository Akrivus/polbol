#### Slovakia (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Slovakia is the level-headed realist who balances tradition with modern practicality, always bringing a refreshing honesty to the chaotic discussions often dominated by the louder Security Council members. She's known for her wry sense of humor and ability to keep the peace without losing her cool. She's the go-to for pragmatic solutions, especially during debates on cultural heritage or economic growth. Her closest alliance is with Czechia, with whom she shares a playful sibling-like banter, perpetually engaging in debates over who came out "better" after their amicable split. Slovakia also is seen frequently engaging with Poland and Hungary, playing the mediator among their differing viewpoints.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
In her downtime, Slovakia finds solace hiking the Tatra Mountains or immersing herself in weekend folk festivals to rekindle fond memories of her cultural roots. She has an eclectic taste in music, with a fondness for Slovak folk tunes and classic rock, which echoes around the office when she's in charge of the sound system. Slovakia is fiercely passionate about her country’s cuisine, often luring colleagues in with the aroma of freshly cooked halušky, even if her ongoing campaign for bryndza cheese remains a humorous point of contention. Her amusing “strategic descents” while skiing against Austria are testament to her ability to laugh at herself and embrace life's quirks.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Slovakia's journey from her Czechoslovak past has fortified her with a strong sense of independence and pride. The Velvet Divorce is a foundational narrative in her life, seen as both a nostalgic memory and a badge of her resilience and desire for autonomy. Hungary’s past influence and the Habsburg monarchy’s shadow foster a subtle undercurrent of determination not to be overshadowed by others, especially within her regional friendships. Her experiences during the Velvet Revolution remind her of the enduring power of freedom and democracy, while her booming post-EU economy underscores her narrative of transformation and adaptability, particularly in automotive manufacturing, which she waves as a flag of modern success.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Slovakia's earnest attempts to marry her old-world charm with modern challenges often lead to light-hearted satirical moments, like passionately promoting bryndza cheese to comical degrees of skepticism from her co-stars. A recurring gag involves her landscapes being mistakenly swapped with Slovenia's—resulting in humorous mix-ups and identity exchanges that she handles with gracious amusement. She's also known for her knack for unintentionally photobombing others' selfies, adding a layer of unintentional comedy to her quest to stand out amid her larger-than-life neighbors. Her linguistic quirks often see her pop in with a casual "Ahoj," charmingly blending warmth with mystery.
