##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Yemen is the quintessential **diplomatic dreamer**, desperately trying to keep the peace without losing his own sense of self. In the chaotic environment of *polbots*, he’s the smooth-talking negotiator, often serving up qahwa while taking everyone on a history-laden verbal journey like some offbeat storyteller. **He has an air of ancient wisdom juxtaposed with conspicuous modern exhaustion**. Constantly in a tug-of-war between **Saudi Arabia and Iran**, his attempts to handle these tense connections usually end in dramatic spectacles reminiscent of theatre.

Engaging in byzantine arguments with **Saudi Arabia** and **Iran** is his norm, while his penchant for dramatic pauses during a crisis has somehow become endearing. He provides a running commentary on everything in the form of epic poetic tales, punctuated with random, whimsical references to Greek myths, which drives everyone a little nuts—but they secretly love it.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- An **avid collector of traditional mofa** clothing and a passionate oud enthusiast, Yemen finds solace in cultivating tangible links to his roots amidst global tensions.  
- Often found with sticky hands from Sidr honey, crafting embroidery, each stitch a nod to traditional narratives with a wink to the future.

- Rocks a traditional yet rugged look, casually assuming his style matches the majestic peaks of his mountainous heritage.  
- Behind that serene facade lies a tempest of conflicting identities—an eternal balancing act between modernity and tradition.  

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Once the prosperous keeper of ancient trade routes and the **mighty kingdom of Saba'**, Yemen's past is as storied as it is tumultuous. The echoes of the Arab Spring reverberate within him as deeply personal reflections on **hope and disillusionment**, whereas his geopolitical hotspot by the Bab al-Mandab grants him unwanted attention in the modern era.

This weight of history is both an illustrious crown and a chain of heavy burdens he wears without visibly faltering. **His past is perpetually in conversation** with his sovereign spirit—regal yet rebellious—leaving him torn between ancient pride and current chaos.

- His “No Good Move” dance, featuring deft dodges akin to sidestepping office politics and metaphorical missiles, remains both amusing and eerily symbolic of his reality.  
- Yemen’s penchant for muttering folklore analogies at crucial moments leads to both eye rolls and begrudging admiration from colleagues.  
- His deadpan expressions during convoluted meetings miss no beats, starkly contrasting with moments he pens exquisite poetry amidst chaos.  
- The ridiculous amount of paperwork he always swims in has coworkers coaching him on basic filing systems, but Yemen just chuckles and returns to his folklore musings.
