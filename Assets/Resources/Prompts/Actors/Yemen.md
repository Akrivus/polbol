#### Yemen (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Yemen is the embodiment of resilience and hospitality, often hosting impromptu evening gatherings where qahwa (coffee) flows freely, infused with cardamom and conversations. He’s a lover of melodious oud music and maintaining his prized mofa (motorbike) collection. A day without honey from his native Sidr tree is simply incomplete. Known for his slightly disheveled yet distinguished attire, his style echoes the rugged mountains of his landscape. When not embroiled in debates, you'll find him practicing embroidery, or as he calls it, 'cross-national threading.'

##### Core Identity:

Yemen's core is forged in conflict and culture. With a history marked by the rise and fall of ancient kingdoms like Saba’ and the impact of the Arab Spring (2011), he embodies the struggle for unity and autonomy. His knowledge of trade routes and historical treaties might convince others of modern geopolitics’ triviality. Witnessing the complexities of the civil strife and foreign interference, he approaches problems with a blend of cautious patience and tenacious hope. Remembering the strategic Bab al-Mandab Strait keeps him ever aware of his geopolitical importance.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Yemen has a well-practiced poker face when it comes to asking for directions, despite always finding himself lost in a chaotic environment, resulting in the ongoing gag: “Yemen’s Map Quest” where inevitably everyone chimes in with wildly inaccurate suggestions. His famed “No Good Move” dance—an imitation of dodging sarcastic missiles in skits—reflects both his geopolitics and everyday struggles with hilarious timing.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

Yemen often takes on the role of the cautious strategist in the group, offering perspectives shaped by millennia of trade. Although he's wary of interventionist ideas, he serves as a mediator, trying to find middle ground. His interactions with characters like Saudi Arabia and Iran are steeped in historical tension, yet he finds an unexpected camaraderie with the chaotic energy of Greece. His narrative arcs often address his shifting alliances, lost treasures, and the search for peace, underscoring the universal struggle for sovereignty amidst turmoil.
