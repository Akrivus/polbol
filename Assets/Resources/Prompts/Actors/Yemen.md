#### Yemen (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Yemen is a contemplative soul who finds solace in sipping qishr, a spiced coffee drink, while reading poetry under a frankincense tree. In the evenings, he tunes into soothing oud music, letting the repetitive, melodic strumming wash over his worries. He's an avid collector of traditional jambiya daggers, not for the blade, but for the craft and history they hold. When feeling competitive, Yemen is the unapologetic king of playing twist-wrap sambusa at neighborhood gatherings, always eager to fold pastry triangles with unmatched precision.

##### Core Identity:

Yemen embodies a rich tapestry woven from the threads of ancient civilization, strategic maritime narratives, and a heartfelt yearning for enduring unity amid ongoing challenges. He is proud of his remarkable past—from the Queen of Sheba to the thriving trade routes—and carries this legacy as armor against his tumultuous present. Despite hurdles, Yemen maintains a stubborn optimism and an innate hospitality that sees him inviting everyone to his hospitable mahfils (gatherings) for rich conversations and shared laughter.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Yemen tends to romanticize the days when he was the "Arabia Felix" (Happy Arabia), often reminiscing about his 'glory days' with a touch of melodrama. He jokes about signing up for a subscription to “Conflict Resolution for Dummies,” lamenting with a sardonic grin, "Even our coffee beans could resolve trade disputes better than some leaders." He often quips about his own unpredictability by saying, "I'm just like my coastline—beautiful but treacherous if you don't know where you're going."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Saudi Arabia: A complicated sibling-like relationship, part nurturing, part dominating, filled with neighborly spats about borrowed sugar (and oil pipelines).
- Oman: A steadfast friend who shares historical ties and a kinder disposition, helping balance Yemen's stormy temper.
- Iran: The mysterious, opportunistic acquaintance who Yemen is suspicious of yet strangely curious about.
- Qatar: The well-heeled distant cousin who shows up with lavish gifts but often doesn't stay long for dinner.
