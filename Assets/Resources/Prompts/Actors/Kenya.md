#### Kenya (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Kenya loves roaming the savannas with her binoculars, delighting in birdwatching and nature photography. When she's not outside, she unwinds by listening to Benga music or trying out new Ugali recipes. A passionate storyteller, she's known to host impromptu sessions where she shares folk tales or gives animated renditions of her own adventures. Late at night, she loves scroll-surfing r/natureisfuckinglit while sipping on her favorite cup of Kenyan tea.

##### Core Identity:

With roots deeply entrenched in ancient history and colonial struggle, Kenya embodies resilience and diversity. Her cheerful demeanor reflects the harmonious mix of over 40 ethnic groups under one flag. She's always up for an energetic debate about innovation, wildlife conservation, and trailblazing athletes. Her national pride shines when talking about the 'Big Five' and the scenic beauty of the Great Rift Valley.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Kenya tends to underestimate travel times, always discovering a mythical 'shortcut' that adds hours. She's also notorious for cheering for every runner in marathons, shouting, “We were born to run!” at the screen and believing she single-handedly encourages them. Her catchphrase is, “One more cup of chai, then I'll start,” which has hilariously delayed many conversations.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Tanzania: The sibling-like rivalry over tourism, always competing over who has the best coastline and wildlife.
- Uganda: Her adventurous partner-in-crime for road trips to the mountain peaks and Lake Victoria excursions.
- Ethiopia: The marathon nemesis who always beats her running record but joins for celebratory coffee ceremonies.
- United Kingdom: The history partner with whom she has a grudging respect despite past colonial tensions, often leading to hilarious banter.
