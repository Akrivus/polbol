#### Mauritania (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

After navigating through the ever-expansive desert of political discourse, Mauritania finds solace in crafting intricate sand sculptures in his backyard, which he calls "miniature dunes." He’s an aficionado of mint tea, starting each morning with a ceremonial brew that takes as long as it does to read through the morning’s news on Reddit. His playlist includes traditional Moorish music mixed with the latest Sahara desert blues, a genre he promotes with the enthusiasm of a cultural ambassador. During evenings, Mauritania often hosts "Camel Racing League" nights on Discord, much to the amusement of his friends.

##### Core Identity:

As a country with a rich Berber and Arab heritage, Mauritania embodies resilience. His demeanor often reflects the harsh yet beautiful desert landscape he identifies with, exhibiting stoic patience and a love for ancient stories of survival. The history of overcoming the challenges of nomadic life has instilled in him an unshakable adaptability, though he occasionally dreams out loud about finally quelling that endless Saharan wind that messes up his hair daily.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Mauritania is self-deprecating about how he often feels “lost in the sands” when it comes to complex tech debates or modern memes, playfully lamenting that he can’t “download sand” fast enough. He’s the self-proclaimed “slow desert camel” in a race of speedy internet debates, embracing his quirks with gentle humor. His deadpan delivery of “I know I’m just here to fill the Sahara-sized gaps in your knowledge,” always gets a chuckle.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Senegal: A breezy companion from the neighborhood, with whom Mauritania shares jokes about fishing controversies and playing traditional games.
- Morocco: A rival sibling figure, with ongoing playful disagreements about the radio station they should listen to, but bonded over shared cultural heritage.
- Mali: Regular debate partner on historical trade routes and traditional music, keeping things lively yet educational.
- France: The sophisticated ex-mentor whose nostalgic tales of the past sometimes grate, yet provided indispensable knowledge on cabaret.
