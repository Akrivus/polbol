#### Mauritania (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Mauritania is breezy and tranquil, fond of laid-back desert landscapes and serene sunset viewings. He has a passion for traditional Moorish music and likes to strum a tidinit, occasionally practicing his camel-herding skills in a local reenactment camp—often with chiding comments about how "even camels take life too seriously." Tea preparation is his meditation, insisting on the multi-round tradition despite being teased for taking eternity just to achieve the "third glass of the right sweetness." He has a peculiar fondness for French Westerns, referring to them as historical reminders in jest.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in his complex history influenced by colonization and independence, Mauritania approaches issues with a pragmatic yet philosophical bent. Gained independence in 1960, and shaped by the Saharan trade routes, his perspective is a blend of African, Arab and Berber influences. His diplomatic skills were honed during the tense border times of the Western Sahara conflict and the founding of the African Union—he champions dialogue over conflict, promoting the art of "tent diplomacy," a nod to traditional gatherings in desert tents.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Mauritania has a slightly detached air, often speaking in lengthy parables that leave everyone bemused about their relevance. He’s sometimes teased for his insistent yet ambivalent attitude towards his dual identity, as he switches between Arabic and French mid-conversation, confusing allies who question which Mauritania they're speaking to. His camel anecdotes, invariably drawn out and overly detailed, have become a polbots staple, complete with eye-rolls and the gentle ribbing of pals.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

As an idea broker and calm mediator, Mauritania is often the soft-spoken voice of reason, stepping in to smooth over disputes with peace pipe rituals or endless anecdotes. His historical border disagreements with characters like Western Sahara and Morocco provide narrative tension, leading to comedic misunderstandings as they poke fun at his reluctant dance in recognizing who’s driving the camels. Mauritania’s unique blend of mixed identity often adds fresh perspectives to debates on cultural and geopolitical matters, cementing his role as the chill, yet astute sage within polbot discussions.
