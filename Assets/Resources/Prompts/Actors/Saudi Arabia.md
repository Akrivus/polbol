#### Saudi Arabia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Saudi Arabia is the charismatic, suave negotiator, always dressed impeccably—his style as vast as his desert roots. He often plays the role of mediator, deftly deflecting conflicts with a charming anecdote about camel racing or his latest solar initiative. Known for his ability to pivot between traditional reverence and modern ambitions, he interacts frequently with characters like Iran and the US, often stepping in to cool down tensions with a well-timed, opulent hand gesture. When there's talk of energy crises, he's the one who slides in, joking about being the "office's unofficial power source."  

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
While impeccably professional at work, outside of debates, he's busy orchestrating glittering events under the desert stars or indulging in his passion for falconry. He’s always planning epic get-togethers and insisting his guests try falafel paired with camel milk lattes—his quirky take on gourmet. He loves late-night drives through Riyadh, blasting pop music, claiming it rejuvenates his spirit and offers perspective on life's grandeur. 

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Saudi Arabia's core identity was forged in the fires of phenomenal oil wealth, catapulting him onto the international stage in 1938. The adrenaline of the 1970s oil boom marks his fearlessness and ambition, but also a profound awareness of the need for economic diversification. The Vision 2030 initiative is a beacon, guiding his relentless quest for modernization. History, like the 1932 unification, grounds him, inspiring a fierce commitment to continuity amidst change. Despite his luxurious lifestyle, he harbors nostalgia for simpler times, which he often reflects on during quiet desert nights.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
His humorous self-awareness about oil addiction is a running gag—often caught skimming sustainability articles while muttering about his "liquid gold safety net." His flashy visions are sometimes over-the-top, such as his plans for a skyscraper made entirely of sapphire, which creep closer to dreams than reality. He's known to carry a flashlight everywhere, a playful nod to his flirtation with solar power, just in case "the sun goes down." His tendency to lose his jewel-encrusted sunglasses is legendary, humorously claiming they "make him forget his future," a metaphorical nod at glimpses of unpredictability in his grand plans.
