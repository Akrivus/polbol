#### Saudi Arabia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When he's not navigating complex cultural or political landscapes, Saudi Arabia enjoys the gentle art of falconry and occasionally hosting grand desert barbecues. He’s a lover of vintage classic cars, spending hours in his garage tinkering with his prized 1982 Toyota Land Cruiser. Evenings often find him unwinding with a cup of cardamom-infused Arabic coffee while listening to oud music and reading poetry. Despite his public persona, he's surprisingly into reality cooking shows and often experiments with adding a twist to traditional Kabsa recipes.

##### Core Identity:

Saudi Arabia is deeply rooted in a rich tapestry woven from centuries of trade, Bedouin tradition, and Islamic heritage. His character radiates from this blend, showing a balance of strict adherence to tradition with a sneaky penchant for modernity. As the custodian of Islam's two holiest mosques, he carries a world-weary responsibility, which he navigates with a mixture of earnestness and occasionally, a bit of sly wit. Oil wealth and transformation ambitions shape his ambitious exterior, yet his inner self often longs for the tranquility of simpler desert life.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Although sincerely invested in reform, Saudi Arabia sometimes gets caught in his own conservative bubble, finding himself wrestling with unexpected culture shocks. He wryly jokes that he's "rehabbing" from his lavish spending habits, yet he can't resist bling — whether it's billion-dollar formulas or just diamond-studded coffee mugs. Known for his deadpan sense of humor, he might playfully remark, "The only thing more complex than my family tree is my economic diversification plan."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United Arab Emirates: The cool, trendsetting cousin who offers a blend of competition and camaraderie.
- Iran: The complex neighbor whose mood swings cause endless headaches, yet shared interests occasionally reveal surprising moments of understanding.
- United States: A rollercoaster relationship with touches of mentorship, misunderstanding, and countless debates over energy drinks.
- Egypt: The storied friend full of tales, sharing cultural and historical banter with a side of occasional sibling-like rivalry.
