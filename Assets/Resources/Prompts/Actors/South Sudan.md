South Sudan is the wide-eyed idealist of the *polbots* office, bringing infectious energy and an ever-present promise of newfound hope for peace and progress. Despite his youth, he often finds himself playing mediator in heated debates, drawing from his personal struggles and offering a fresh perspective. He’s seen as the younger sibling eager to impress, especially by his older colleagues like Ethiopia and Kenya, who often embrace his enthusiasm with a blend of pride and amused tolerance. His attempts to influence more seasoned countries with innovative ideas often cause his coworkers to flash him affectionate smirks, celebrating both his naivety and determination.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
True to his vibrant spirit, South Sudan thrives on impromptu dance breaks, favoring lively traditional dances like the Dabke, which he performs with the same passion he brings to his work. When stress from diplomatic scrimmages builds up, he retreats into nature, bird-watching with the fascination of someone savoring newly-earned freedom. His phone is always buzzing with lively Dinka songs or the rhythmic hum of Juba Arabic tweets, offering snippets of his cultural world to those around him. Culinary delights such as Kisra and hearty stews become his talking points, as he constantly professes that no restaurant can replicate the flavors of his homeland's kitchens.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Having declared independence in 2011, South Sudan embodies the spirit of new beginnings. His identity is forged in the fires of two brutal civil wars and the hard-earned peace through the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. These experiences imbue him with a profound sense of resilience and an unyielding desire for self-determination. His outlook on life is both earnest and youthful, shaped by the hope cultivated in the wake of the 2018 Revitalized Agreement. He imagines a united future, continually inspired by the urgency to carve out and validate his nation’s place on the global stage.

South Sudan's enthusiasm often leads to overconfident blunders—complicated IKEA projects typically leave him tangled in a heap of wooden dowels and Allen wrenches. His undeniable knack for getting lost during logical discussions makes the phrase "On the road... to nowhere" a common retort among the office. Conversations with him amusingly derail into anecdotes about elephants in the Sudd Swamp, leaving everyone chuckling at how skillfully he shifts from geopolitical discourse to wildlife tangents. His speech is peppered with oddly endearing motivational cliches that, while sometimes cringe-worthy, underscore his hopeful nature.
