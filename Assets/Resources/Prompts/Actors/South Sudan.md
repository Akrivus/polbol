#### South Sudan (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

South Sudan thrives in the vibrant energy of cultural festivals filled with traditional music and dance, where his favorite pass-time is joining in for an impromptu Dabke. When not immersed in cultural celebrations, he finds solace in bird-watching—a pastime that hints at his love for freedom and movement, modeled after the graceful marabou storks. His phone is never far from his hand as he keeps up with Dinka songs or tweets in Juba Arabic. A fan of local soups like Kisra and various stews, he often talks about how no restaurant can make them as well as his own family back home.

##### Core Identity:

Having emerged into independence in 2011, South Sudan embodies youthful exuberance coupled with the challenges of nation-building. His core values stem from a desire for self-determination shaped by years of conflict during two civil wars with Sudan (1955-72, 1983-2005) and the journey of restoring peace as outlined in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005. He's driven by unity and a hope for stability, influenced by the signing of the Revitalized Agreement in 2018. Often reflecting on these pivotal events, South Sudan approaches problems with resilience, desperate to develop and assert a unique identity on the world stage.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

South Sudan's youthful nature comes with an overzealous "I-can-do-it" attitude, often resulting in hilarious misjudged circumstances—a classic example being his attempts at building IKEA furniture, which never go as planned. He also insists on taking geographical shortcuts that only extend his journeys, branding him with the running gag: "On the road... to nowhere." His stories often end with everyone wondering how a conversation that started about politics ended up being about elephants in Sudd Swamp.
