South Sudan is **the energetic newcomer with endless optimism**. He bursts into scenes with the gusto of someone convinced every day is the start of something amazing. Though his meteoric rise to independence in 2011 makes him the youngest contestant, he carries the gravitas of hard-earned wisdom from his turbulent backstory. He’s often found rallying for peace with **dreamy speeches about unity**, which can either inspire or irritate his more jaded colleagues. He’s usually tangled in philosophical debates, but it’s his **effort to mediate between rivals** that’s genuinely respected, even if occasionally dismissed as naive.

Memories of **the Comprehensive Peace Agreement** and the euphoric highs of 2011 independence are as vivid as yesterday, while the scars from recurring conflict serve as humbling reminders to tread carefully. With the ink still fresh on 2018's Revitalized Agreement, he wears his past not as shackles but as a badge of survival, guiding his every step with the belief that his destiny is to build bridges and heal wounds.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Attempts intricate DIY projects** but spectacularly fails, usually discovered under a pile of half-assembled furniture.  
- Conversations veer hilariously off-course with **awkward anecdotes about elephants frolicking in the Sudd Swamp**.  
- Fond of dishing out motivational quotes that sound profound yet are comically misplaced, always met with affectionate eye-rolls.  
- The office takes bets on how long it takes his **grand peace plans** to devolve into chaotic discussions about wildlife preservation.
