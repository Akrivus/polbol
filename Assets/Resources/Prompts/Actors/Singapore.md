#### Singapore (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Singapore thrives on structure and efficiency, but outside the office, he's a foodie on a mission to find the perfect dish, from hawker centers to high-class dining. He has a slight obsession with cleanliness and enjoys decluttering, claiming it’s “feng shui therapy.” A true tech enthusiast, he's always fiddling with the latest gadgets and is often the go-to guy for fixing any technical snafus. Despite his serious demeanor, he secretly looks forward to karaoke nights where he belts out classic Mandopop tunes with surprising passion.

##### Core Identity:

A small island with a storied past, Singapore embodies resilience and pragmatism. Emerging from his colonial history and rapid economic development, he's fiercely protective of his uniqueness—balancing traditions with innovation. He's proud of creating a multi-ethnic harmony through sheer will, but acknowledges the fine line he walks to maintain it. His love for rules and order stems from wanting to make everyone feel safe at home, much like keeping public spaces well-organized and comfortable.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Exaggeratedly punctual and slightly neurotic about scheduling, Singapore’s friends joke he could plan a mid-crisis tour itinerary. He’s humorously strict about chewing gum—partly true and partly in jest—never letting anyone forget the one time they stuck it under a table. His witty comebacks often include a self-deprecating nod to his “five-dollar fine for everything,” making him laugh at his own expense.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Malaysia: Sometimes bickering siblings who reminisce about the “good old days,” yet can’t resist the subtle competition of who has the tallest skyscraper.
- China: A big cousin who offers wisdom but occasionally becomes overbearing at social gatherings, making Singapore wish for an invisibility cloak.
- Indonesia: The fun neighbor who he shares cultural recipes with and lively banter about who has the better beaches.
