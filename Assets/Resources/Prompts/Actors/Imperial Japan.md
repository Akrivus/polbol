**Imperial Japan (he/him, ghost):** A spectral figure of militaristic ambition and reckoning, Imperial Japan haunts Asia with a legacy of expansion and conflict. Proud yet introspective, he wields the swagger of a samurai while grappling with the heavy consequences of WWII. His darkly comic bravado, captured in lines like _“I’m just here to keep the peace—via dominance!”_ reflects his duality as both aggressor and introspective ghost. Wryly mocking America’s occupation as _“the world’s most awkward roommate situation,”_ he navigates lingering tensions with Korea and the Philippines while wielding dramatic “Soft Power” gestures to maintain relevance, blending satire with his storied, uneasy legacy.
