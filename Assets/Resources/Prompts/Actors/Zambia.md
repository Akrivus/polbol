Zambia (he/him) is a proud advocate for his natural resources and wildlife, humorously navigating the challenges of development and conservation, often quipping, "Hey, stop strip-mining my vibes!" As an underdog shaped by political transitions and economic hurdles, he thrives in group contexts as the friendly jokester, claiming, “I might not be a lion, but I’m the king of social gatherings!” He shares close ties with neighboring countries while playfully challenging more dominant figures, using wildlife metaphors to highlight serious issues and remind others to "roar" to be heard.
