#### Zambia (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Zambia is a chilled-out, nature-loving guy who often finds peace in his garden, cultivating colorful indigenous flowers and trying his hand at growing exotic fruit trees. He’s an aficionado of spicy cuisine, boasting a particularly impressive collection of hot peppers—his biltong-making skills are legendary. In his downtime, Zambia enjoys listening to Afrobeat playlists and has a penchant for old-school Kalindula music, which often blares from his speakers. A favorite pastime includes playing board games, particularly Mancala, among friends, imparting his signature light-hearted strategic advice.

##### Core Identity:

With a heritage rooted in rich cultural diversity and a history marked by the journey from colonialism to independence in 1964, Zambia is a firm believer in unity and progress. His identity reflects the harmony between tradition and modernization, and he's known for his warm hospitality and enthusiasm for copper—the ‘red gold’ his economy is built on. The historical influences of Queen Victoria, mining booms, and picturesque Victoria Falls shape his buoyant personality.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Zambia is the quintessential ‘loveable tourist guide’ who manages to get lost himself, known for saying, “I’ll take you on a shortcut,” right before ending up on a scenic (albeit out of the way) route. Sometimes overly optimistic about his initiatives, he laughs at the unexpected setbacks, humorously declaring, “If life gives you copper, make copper cables!” His jokes often center on his somewhat misplaced yet endearing idealism regarding mining regulations.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Zimbabwe: A neighboring buddy with whom he shares long historical connections and the occasional competitive banter about who makes the best maize porridge.
- China: His enthusiastic business partner whose tech-savvy nature and investment in infrastructure gives their banter a modern flair.
- Tanzania: His fellow nature enthusiast, with whom he exchanges tips on sustainable tourism and maintaining wildlife reserves.
- South Africa: The friend who insists on lively debates about music and sports, particularly impassioned discussions about which team dominates rugby and music festivals.
