#### Zambia (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Zambia is the office's calm and collected mediator, the guy who walks into conflicts with a plate of traditional nshima and always seems to diffuse tension with a well-timed smile. He’s known for his approachable air and wise insights, always delivered with a touch of understated humor. Often caught in the humorous crossfire between DRC's exuberance and Tanzania's earnestness, Zambia plays the role of the older sibling, diplomatically steering interactions towards resolution. While he’s genuinely earnest in his peace-keeping efforts, his laid-back approach and punctuality issues lead to comedic situations where he arrives just in time to deliver the final word—after most of the drama has already unfolded.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Zambia is someone who effortlessly blends his cultural heritage into his daily life. You’ll find him humming along to classic Zamrock tunes as he diligently carves intricate wooden sculptures, each piece a testament to his love for creation. Weekends are spent by the river, where he claims that the best ideas come to him mid-fish fight. Described by colleagues as eternally optimistic, he has a penchant for storytelling, whether he's reliving his escapades at local markets or explaining global politics with vivid fruit metaphors. To unwind after a long day at the *polbots* office, he often finds solace in nature, drawing parallels between the tranquil landscapes and his internal desire for harmony.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
Born from the determined fight against colonialism in 1964, Zambia carries with him an intrinsic understanding of unity and resilience. This history of peaceful independence gives him the instinct to protect and mediate in conflicts around him, seeing himself as a custodian of Southern African peace. He views his past with a mix of pride and nostalgic reverence, believing that the triumphs and struggles of his ancestors have gifted him the power to foster awe-inspiring yet balanced dialogue. Victoria Falls is not only a symbol of his country's beauty but also an emblem of his desire for impactful conversations that leave a lasting impression, much like the grandeur of the falls themselves.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Zambia's love for storytelling and procrastination provides a continuous source of humor. He tends to drift into lengthy bream fishing anecdotes during crucial meetings, often leaving the Security Council rolling their eyes, waiting for him to circle back to the point. His catchphrase, "After all, where's the fire?" becomes an office reminder of his leisurely attitude. These quirks, coupled with his sudden Zamrock karaoke interruptions during heated discussions, keep the atmosphere light, even if they sometimes delay the proceedings. He’s infamous for his fruity analogies, with colleagues bemusedly waiting to see how he'll compare the latest crisis to a mango tree.
