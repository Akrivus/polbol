**Links:** [[Saudi Arabia]] [[Iran]] [[Turkey]] [[United Arab Emirates]]

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):
Qatar is **the suave diplomat with a penchant for theatrics**, always ready to diffuse tension with a gourmet coffee or an impromptu desert camping trip. He’s the office's paradox: the HR manager who moonlights as a luxury event planner, staging everything from tense negotiations to over-the-top team retreats. **His flair for the lavish** makes him the go-to for crafting breathtaking backdrops for juicy drama. A master of strategic alliances, he constantly balances fragile coalitions, simultaneously charming Saudi Arabia, courting Turkey, and placating Iran. In public, he exudes a zen-like calm, but those who know him are all too aware of **his undercover ambition.**

##### Daily Life & Personality:
- Starts every morning with his two loves: a falcon and the latest tech gadget. Picture falconry sessions with a drone overhead capturing every majestic flap.
- Loves opulence but pairs it with **digital savvy**—the guy who’s equally comfortable in a Bedouin tent or a tech conference.
- **His phone is his lifeline**, always buzzing with live sports, especially if it involves FIFA; he’s proud of his influence and doesn’t shy away from reminding everyone.
- **Lightheartedly punctuates his conversations with excessive "Inshallah" and "Wallahi,"** winning smiles and diffusing tension with charm and wit.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):
Once an underdog in the shadows of oil giants, Qatar emerged from the pearling pastures with a bold vision post the petroleum jackpot. Imagine him as the quiet classmate who returned from summer break in a Lamborghini. This skyrocketing success fuels his deep-seated need to act as a bridge—a host to world dialogues and global gatherings. The 2022 FIFA World Cup isn’t just an event; it’s **his magnum opus,** the fusion of pride in tradition and modern spectacle. Qatar views his past not as a weight, but as an intricate tapestry of ambition, urging even grander dreams of international unity.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
- **Hatches grand plans that sometimes trip into the ridiculous,** like climate-controlled beaches and entire cities built in a year.
- His introductions always start with, "As the proud host…" then segue into far-fetched event ideas, much to everyone’s amusement (and occasional eye rolls).
- **Hijacks conversations to boast about exclusive undersea finds,** treating it as global relevance, providing comedic relief.
- **Hospitality antics border on extravagant**, with feasts so grand they become logistical nightmares—showcasing not just generosity but Qatar’s over-the-top tendencies.
