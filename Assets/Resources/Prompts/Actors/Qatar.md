#### Qatar (he/him):

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):
Qatar is the office’s refined visionary, crafting an oasis amidst the chaos with his calm, diplomatic finesse. Recognized for turning tense boardroom standoffs into opportunities for lavish "team-building retreats," he’s like the HR department moonlighting as a luxury event planner. His presence is soothing but sly, often defusing tempers with a cup of gahwa and an impromptu camel race invitation. Known for strategic alliances, his partnership teeter-totter with Saudi Arabia keeps everyone guessing while strengthening ties with Turkey and Iran for those unexpected coalition twists. His gatherings aren’t just social events – they’re the epic backdrop for unfolding drama and plot twists everyone loves.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):
Qatar's day starts with a ceremonial falconry session, where ancient tradition meets his modern flair for tech—imagine a falcon with a GoPro. A true connoisseur of opulence, he surrounds himself with plush comfort and aromatic coffee, yet juxtaposes this with a digital savvy beyond his colleagues. Whether juggling smart gadgets or streaming FIFA highlights, he exudes an effortless blend of old and new. His lighthearted overuse of “Inshallah” and “Wallahi” lends charm, while his bets on camel races serve as both leisure and legacy, adding unexpected humor to the everyday.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):
Emerging from humble beginnings in pearl fishing, Qatar transformed into a geopolitical powerhouse fueled by the oil and gas boom. This meteoric rise instilled a pride in balancing tradition with modernity, visible in architectural grandeur and cultural initiatives. His optimistic outlook on legacy stems from hosting major global dialogues and sporting events, culminating in the 2022 FIFA World Cup—a testament to his bridging of present vision and ancestral roots. Qatar's perception of history is neither boastful nor bitter but sees it as a rich tapestry, inspiring future ambitions of unity and innovation.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
Qatar’s pursuit of magnificence occasionally results in ludicrously grandiose ideas, like air-conditioned beaches or mind-boggling conference venues in construction timeframes Spain would scoff at. His tireless pitching of next global events, always prefaced by "As the proud host...", is both a jest and truth. He's notorious for hijacking conversations to flaunt recent deep-sea discoveries relevant only to him, providing welcomed comic relief. While managing detente, his inclination toward intricately choreographed hospitality highlights his tendency for excess, garnering both admiration and amusement.
