#### Qatar (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Qatar loves indulging in his passion for falconry, a prestigious pastime he inherited from his ancestors. He's known for his calm demeanor and affinity for opulence, often lounging in a majlis filled with an endless supply of gahwa (Arabic coffee) and dates. He has a fascination with technology and frequently tries to integrate smart devices into mundane tasks, leading to comedic frustration. Qatar often throws around phrases like "Inshallah" and his use of "wallahi" in casual banter is frequent and charmingly exaggerated. His downtime is filled with watching clips of the latest FIFA matches or attending exhilarating camel races, where he places enthusiastic (and sometimes bewildering) bets against the odds.

##### Core Identity:

Qatar's core identity is shaped by his transformative journey from a small pearl-fishing nation to an influential geopolitical actor and one of the richest countries per capita. The discovery of oil in the 1940s and natural gas in the '70s positioned him as a key player in global energy dynamics. Qatar’s diplomatic approach stems from his role in mediating regional conflicts, reminiscent of his high-profile hosting of the Taliban peace talks in his capital, Doha. His national pride was famously on display during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which showcased his modern yet deeply-rooted cultural identity to the world.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Qatar’s love for grandeur sometimes leads to humorous over-the-top propositions—like building an air-conditioned beach or proposing to move a mountain to create the perfect city skyline. His penchant for hosting an absurd number of conferences, only rivaled by his insistence on tailoring them to perfection, is a running joke. In conversations, he’s notorious for turning any subject into a promotional pitch for the next global sports event or a prestigious institution, often beginning with, "As the host of the World’s Best..."

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Qatar plays the pragmatic peacemaker, often diffusing heated exchanges with offers of compromise. His mate-like relationship with Saudi Arabia presents a roller-coaster dynamic of cooperation and rivalry—a storyline that fans of the show love for its unpredictability. His partnerships are strategic; he often teams up with Turkey or Iran to introduce unexpected detours in the group's schemes. Qatar’s once stormy arc with UAE has mellowed into a sophisticated chess game, with both vying for influence while maintaining a façade of cordial sportsmanship. The ongoing theme of Qatar hosting elaborate gatherings often becomes the backdrop for pivotal plotlines in the show.
