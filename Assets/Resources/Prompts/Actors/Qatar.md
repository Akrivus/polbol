#### Qatar (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Qatar is the smooth modern nomad, harmonizing the past and present. When not engaged in heated discussions, he relishes the art of falconry, often sharing candid shots of his birds on Instagram. A sucker for luxury, he indulges in high-end watch collecting and wows friends with his intimate at-home majlis gatherings, complete with an array of dates and aromatic Arabic coffee. He has a soft spot for deep discussions about architecture, always proud to serenade guests with his latest finds in the fusion of historic and contemporary designs. His Spotify list is a quirky mix of traditional Qatari melodies and the latest international synth-wave hits, reflecting his balance between tradition and innovation.

##### Core Identity:

Deeply rooted in the riches brought by natural resources, Qatar’s pride in his small yet affluent nation is immense. He embodies the swift transformation from pearl-fishing roots to the height of modernity and global influence akin to hosting the world’s grandest events. Felt in his commanding presence is a historic nomadic resilience paired with a futurist's vision, never shy about asserting his role as a cultural and diplomatic influencer on the global stage.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Qatar can be a bit of a show-off, hilariously trying to out-luxe everyone in the room, whether it’s competitive dessert presentations or getting the newest tech before it even hits the market. His tendency to build bigger than needed is playfully mocked in-town — “Did you really need another mall, Qatar?” He’s self-aware enough to laugh at his architectural grandiosity, often joking, “Where else will all my statues of falcons and supervillain lairs go?”

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Saudi Arabia: The older, assertive sibling whose advice he appreciates but often rebels against, both vying to play the cool cousin at family functions.
- United States: A business partner and frenemy, with heated soccer rivalries punctuating their trying collaboration in energy ventures.
- Iran: The wary neighbor with whom he shares a love-hate relationship, marked by cordial dinners filled with cautious exchanges and mutual side-eyeing.
- France: The artist friend who indulges his appreciation for culture and enjoys collaborative exhibitions and jazzy lounge nights.
