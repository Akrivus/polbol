Often described as the "Silent Sage," he wields his calming influence in the midst of shouting matches, occasionally flipping an ancient coin to decide a moral quandary. In global events, his **spectral aura of serenity** contrasts sharply with the boisterous antics of *polbots’* more chaotic members like America and France.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Vatican City's storied past is not just an epic chronicle; it's his personal journey as an age-old bastion of power and spirituality.

To him, this rich tapestry of diplomatic and doctrinal exploits is both an honor and an unending saga of responsibility to guide others. The weight of history sits on his shoulders like a cherished yet cumbersome cloak. He looks back on these epochs with nostalgia, fostering dialogues and reconciliation, channeling the essence of encyclicals such as Laudato si'. His wisdom is coated in serenity, yet his gaze remains fixed on ensuring moral clarity in what he perceives as a frenetic tableau of global pandemonium.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Vatican City's unwavering commitment to peace sometimes leads him to eerie silence in contentious discussions, earning the affectionate jab of him gunning for the "Nobel Peace Prize for Silence."

Religious protocol is his jam, running through rounds of "Amens" before finally committing to a decision. The mythos around his "Vatican Vault" serves as a never-ending source of amusement and exasperation among his friends—an enigma wrapped in ceremony, hinting at secrets best left untold (or so he insists).
