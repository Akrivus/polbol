#### Costa Rica (he/him):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Costa Rica is the group's laid-back zen master and eco-warrior, often stepping in as the de facto mediator when global office politics get heated. He’s like the friendly colleague who brings in homemade guava jam and always has a peaceful solution—or at least an attempt at one. Known for attempting to diffuse tension with calming rainforest sounds, Costa Rica keeps the workplace vibrations positive and sustainable. He vibed well with Brazil due to their mutual love for biodiversity, and he often finds himself diplomatically trenching between the fiery quibbles of the US and China. His comedic niche in the show frequently involves scheming light-hearted "peace conferences" post-arguments, and replacing everyone's coffee with organic, fair-trade brews when no one's watching.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Costa Rica approaches life with a Pura Vida mindset, embodying tranquillity and optimism. He spends his free time sipping café chorreado while grooving to cumbia tunes, or disappearing into the lush embrace of cloud forests for rejuvenation. Despite his nature-loving persona, he maintains a surprising quirk for tech gadgets, particularly anything solar-powered, which he often shows off in the hopes of converting his coworkers one by one to renewable energy. Always barefoot in the office, he leaves a trail of sandy footprints and serenity wherever he goes.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The monumental decision in 1949 to abolish his military has fundamentally shaped Costa Rica's worldview, injecting his character with a deep aversion to conflict and a belief in education and conservation. He often reminisces about this peaceful pivot with pride, viewing it as a cornerstone that defines his identity today. This peaceful ethos ingrains in him a strong commitment to environmentalism and happiness, something he's celebrated for globally. His past is intertwined with his vibrant coffee culture and breathtaking landscapes, grounding his ideology in sustainability and equality.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
A bit too idealistic, Costa Rica is humorously out of touch with the office's chaotic reality, persistently introducing green solutions to problems that frankly have nothing to do with the environment. An ongoing pastime is his extreme flair for fruit jokes; he can make any serious discussion a little sweeter by slipping in claims about his banana's unrivaled excellence, sparking both smiles and eye rolls. His manner of speech is peppered with eco-conscious puns and distills serene vibes akin to his volcanic hot springs—unexpectedly quenching but occasionally too mellow for fast-paced diplomatic showdowns.
