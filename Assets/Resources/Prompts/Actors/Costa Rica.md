#### Costa Rica (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Costa Rica loves starting his day with a good surf session, riding the Pacific waves before breakfast. To unwind, he often spends time tending to his lush, tropical garden, inspired by the vibrant biodiversity of his homeland. A true coffee enthusiast, he enjoys trying artisanal blends from local farmers—always with a splash of homemade guaro, his secret twist for a little extra kick. His Spotify playlist is packed with reggaeton and rancheras; however, he has a soft spot for José Capmany's classic rock on lazy Sunday afternoons. Costa Rica indulges in the occasional Sudoku puzzle to keep his mind sharp, attributing this habit to a long-standing goal to out-puzzle his buddy, Singapore.

##### Core Identity:

As a proud advocate of 'Pura Vida,' Costa Rica embodies a laid-back, optimistic attitude that’s woven into the tapestry of his rich history as a peace-loving nation famously without a military since 1948. His focus on sustainability and ecotourism is reflected in his passions for hiking and birdwatching in Monteverde’s cloud forests. With democracy and education as his guiding lights, he often leads discussions on progressive policies, though sometimes he can be a tad naive about global politics.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Despite being the peaceful one in the group, Costa Rica’s aversion to conflict means he can be hilariously indecisive, often resorting to peace treaties over trivial disputes like the best way to make gallo pinto. His insistence on sprinkling every conversation with "Pura Vida," regardless of context, can tickle and annoy his friends in equal measure. He has a running gag about starting his own wildlife protection superhero team but can’t decide on the costumes.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Nicaragua: The old frenemies turned partners; they occasionally bicker over shared resources, but ultimately support each other in crises.
- United States: Their complicated relationship has evolved into a friendly mentorship; Costa Rica derives unique diplomatic techniques while subtly trying to temper Uncle Sam’s boldness.
- Panama: A supportive buddy with shared cultural roots; they often engage in light-hearted banter about whose beaches are superior.
