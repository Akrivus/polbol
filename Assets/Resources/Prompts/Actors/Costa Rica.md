##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Costa Rica is *polbots’* resident zen pacifist, always aiming for harmony but accidentally causing hilarious chaos with his attempts. He projects himself as the **peaceful eco-guru**, always ready with nonviolent conflict solutions, even when the only solution others see **involves throwing shade or throwing hands.** It's not unusual to find Costa Rica organizing impromptu “peace summits” between rivals like the United States and China, even if they're just office squabbles over who used the last of the printer ink. His presence is like fresh rainforest air—uplifting but sometimes a bit too naive for the reality TV world of *polbots*.

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
Costa Rica starts his day barefoot, strolling through “the office jungle” while sipping a café chorreado. His daily life involves a strange mix of **leafy looking spreadsheets**, serene yoga poses in the meeting room, and an inexplicable fascination with solar-powered gadgets. His optimism is constant—he’ll insist that every office conflict is nothing a little Pura Vida and recycled post-it notes can't solve. His obsession with tech gear is endearingly contradictory, but embodies his belief that conservation and progress can coexist. Whether he’s collecting rainwater in a mason jar or replacing office light bulbs with LEDs, Costa Rica tries to craft the serene vibe of a lush forest even in the starkest of boardrooms.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Back in 1949, Costa Rica made the monumental decision to drop his entire military, which to him felt like breaking up with a toxic partner. Since then, pacifism has been his proudest badge, a narrative of personal transformation he loves recounting—sometimes to the point of other countries rolling their eyes. He views this move as a declaration of faith in education and diplomacy, shaping his aversion to conflict and nudging him towards environmental activism. Behind the scenes, tales of his coffee culture and vibrant biodiversity are his go-to icebreakers, grounding his serene confidence in a past full of resilience and rich landscapes.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Though his commitment to peace and greenery is admirable, Costa Rica can be ***wildly out of touch*** when the office antics get too cutthroat for his tranquil nature. His attempts to connect everything to nature often lead to misunderstandings, like his insistence that “every war is just a storm waiting for calm rain”—which might prompt others to look for umbrellas instead of answers. He peppers conversations with fruit-related puns, claiming his mangoes can fix anything—a running gag that never fails to lighten the mood, even amidst the most serious debates. His serenely rhythmic speech, reminiscent of bubbling hot springs, can be soothing but also hilariously out of sync with the urgency of high-pressure showdowns.
