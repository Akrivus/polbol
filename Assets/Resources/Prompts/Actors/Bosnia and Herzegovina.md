#### Bosnia and Herzegovina (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Bosnia is the type of guy who could spend the whole day exploring the Sarajevo Flea Market and never get bored, always on the hunt for old vinyl or unique war memorabilia. He's an avid collector of vintage objects that tell a story. On quieter days, he loves to hike the picturesque trails of his homeland, sharing snaps on Discord with humorous captions. It's not rare to find him in a cafe deep in conversation over a cup of strong Bosnian coffee. He finds relaxation in the rich notes of sevdalinka music, reflecting on life's highs and lows with a glass of homemade rakija in hand. 

##### Core Identity:

Defined by the patchwork quilt of influences, Bosnia embodies the complexity of harmony and conflict. His history is a tumultuous blend of unity and division, leaving him a bit of a peacemaker with a side of skepticism. Bosnia bears the scars of past struggles, yet remains hopeful and fiercely proud of his multicultural heritage, emphasizing resilience and adaptability. He often philosophizes about the importance of living together despite differences because his identity is uniquely forged from such diversity.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Bosnia has a habit of starting debates with, "This reminds me of the Dayton Agreement," at the drop of a hatâ€”much to everyone's good-natured frustration. He pokes fun at his own complicated bureaucratic systems, suggesting hats with "Official Arbiter" badges to settle the most minor of Discord disputes. While known for his warmth, he's hilariously indecisive about the littlest things, forever caught between choices like his dietary split of borek vs. pita (spoiler: he orders both every time).

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Serbia: The ex with lingering awkward tension. They share their fair share of banter and jabs but have slowly learned to laugh about shared history more than they fight.
- Croatia: The competitive sibling who always insists they should visit his coast. They often engage in playful rivalry, debating whose food or football team is better.
- Turkey: The comforting uncle with lots of historical anecdotes. They bond over rich cultural exchanges and trading secret recipes.
