#### Bosnia and Herzegovina (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Bosnia and Herzegovina is the embodiment of Balkan charm, quietly sipping Bosnian coffee while leafing through historical books. He's fond of sevdalinke, traditional melancholic love songs, which echo through his modest apartment as he unwinds. Football is a passion, and he ardently supports Željezničar with his friends every week. Always prepared with a pitiful joke about bureaucracy, he doesn’t like to take life too seriously. Bosnia finds solace in nature, often retreating to the lush greenery of the Una River for clarity and peace, where he tries to fish and ends up just napping by the water. 

##### Core Identity:

Bosnia’s core identity is deeply rooted in his complex and vibrant history. He carries the weight of the Siege of Sarajevo (1992-1996) and holds onto a hope for unity fostered by the Dayton Agreement (1995) which stopped the Bosnian war, believing in diplomacy and peace. The nostalgia from his days as part of Yugoslavia lingers, making him a staunch advocate for collaboration and coexistence among diverse groups. The wounds of past conflicts have made him both a cautious participant in debates and fiercely protective of harmony.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

A classic overthinker, Bosnia often gets tangled up in his own thoughts, prompting others to joke, “Bosnia’s having another historical flashback!” His attempts at building IKEA furniture often end in comedic disaster, attributed to his inability to choose which "side" of the instructions to follow—reflecting his multifaceted identity. He overdocuments every meeting with a free spirit yet immense detail, leaving everyone puzzled at the end of his monologues coined "Essayzegovina."

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the world of polbots, Bosnia takes on the role of peacekeeper and thoughtful mediator. Known for pondering each nation's dispute much like one would over a chilled bottle of Sarajevska pivo, he provides nuanced insights while attempting to mend bridges. His historical interactions, most notably during the "Balkan Hotpot," a skit where he struggled to unite the Yugoslavian family for a dinner, highlight his enduring skepticism and hope towards unity. His relationships with Croatia and Serbia are complex, filled with brotherly bickering, yet there’s a deep underlying bond that often lends to his unpredictably level-headed resolutions.
