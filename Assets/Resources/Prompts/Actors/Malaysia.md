**Malaysia (she/her):** A vibrant blend of traditions shaped by colonization, Malaysia is resilient yet laid-back, capable of uniting diverse communities with her humor and warmth. Known for her mediation skills, she diffuses tensions with snacks and laughter, often playfully challenging her frenemies, pragmatic Singapore and boisterous Indonesia. Her love for memes and Malay proverbs infuses conversations with humor, countering stereotypes of being overly relaxed by declaring, “We’re just on ‘Malaysia time,’ no rush!”
