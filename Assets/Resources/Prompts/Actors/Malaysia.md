#### Malaysia (she/her):

##### Everyday Persona:

Malaysia is a vibrant blend of cultures and it shows in her interests. She loves trying out new fusion recipes, often hosting potluck dinners with dishes like nasi lemak tacos or durian cheesecake — tastes are an adventure with her! In her downtime, she crafts traditional batik patterns as a form of meditation and indulges in a good rom-com, her guilty pleasure. While she's a pro at karaoke, she’s known for stubbornly singing off-key to early 2000s pop songs, insisting it’s part of her charm. With an inexplicable attachment to her plushie collection, she drip-feeds escapism from her busy life.

##### Core Identity:

Malaysia’s identity is a tapestry of diverse cultures, with a history of colonial intersections leading to her striking multicultural persona. She balances a deep respect for her history of diverse trade and multiculturalism with an innate desire for harmony — think of a rojak of cultures that she proudly represents. Majestic rainforests and bustling cityscapes both ground and elevate her, turning her into a seamless mix of tradition and modernity, much like her cities booming with skyscrapers and traditional markets.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

She laughs at her internal contradictions, often saying, "I put the ‘multi’ in multicultural mess!" Her friends gently rib her frantic efforts to keep everyone together while juggling her own identity — she’s the quintessential big-hearted friend who believes, slightly exaggeratedly, that she can mediate any conflict with just the right balance of soy sauce in her cooking.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Singapore: The older sibling who moved out early and went for digital transformation. They have a love-hate relationship, complete with squabbles and competitiveness, yet a deep-rooted mutual respect and collaboration.
- Indonesia: The close cousin with whom she shares a deep cultural bond, yet playful spats over who has the best culinary heritage are common.
- Thailand: A friendly neighbor whose zest for life she admires, often leading to shared laughter over delicious meals with less spice tension than might be expected.
