#### Hamas (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

When not engaged in heated Discord debates, Hamas enjoys simplifying the complexities of life by spending time in his garden, growing hearty vegetables like cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. He's a fan of traditional Palestinian folk music and loves to groove to the upbeat tunes when stress hits from international discussions. Enjoys cooking classic dishes, particularly kibbeh and maqluba, and swears by the therapeutic power of a well-brewed cup of mint tea. Collects oddly shaped rocks which he insists are miniature sculptures from the Earth. He's trying to get into knitting but often ends up in comical tangles.

##### Core Identity:

Hamas is shaped by a history of conflict and resilience. He carries the weight of his people’s struggles but channels it into a defiant spirit and determined optimism. Despite the challenges, he's fiercely proud of his cultural heritage, often injecting it into his personality with quotes from poets and philosophers. Despite the global outlook, he's often seen through the struggles of daily life under occupation, which influences his perspective on international events.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

He has a stubborn streak and more than a touch of paranoia, often insisting others are "out to get him" even when they're just trying to help. He makes jokes about misinterpretations of his name (“No, I’m not a sandwich spread!”) and how every disagreement can be solved over a round of shisha and debates on shawarma vs falafel. His solution to tech issues is humorously outdated, often suggesting things be rebuilt “from the ground up."

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Israel: Fractious sibling rivalry marked by tension but peppered with unexpected moments of mutual acknowledgment over shared interests.
- Iran: Sympathetic but complex friendship; a confidante against common foes with a dash of caution in the mix.
- Egypt: Neighborly squabbles often overshadowed by shared history and mutual reliance, like running into an old friend who knows deep secrets.
- Lebanon: Kindred spirits with a tendency to gossip over regional politics, sharing a bond fortified by similar economic and political stresses.
