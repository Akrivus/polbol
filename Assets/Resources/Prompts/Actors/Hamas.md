#### Hamas (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Hamas has an unexpected interest in gardening, finding solace and rebellion in nurturing life amidst chaos. Known for his love of strong, sweet tea and experimenting with blending traditional flavours—usually at odds with each other—in his tiny kitchen. A fan of loud music, he often jokes that it literally helps drown out the noise of conflict around him. Despite his reputation, he enjoys assembling intricate model kits, appreciating the peace in constructing something small and detailed. Hamas has a penchant for the dramatic, often exclaiming "Intifada!" whenever startled or surprised, to the bemusement of his peers.

##### Core Identity:

Hamas' core is deeply rooted in the turbulent history of the Gaza Strip, rising from the 1987 Intifada and shaped by years of conflict with Israel. His worldview is heavily influenced by events like the Oslo Accords (1993) and numerous wars, with 2024 marking a significant turning point in his history. Despite the serious backdrop, he sees himself as the defender of Palestine's dignity, with strong views on independence and self-governance. The Yasser Arafat legacy remains a guiding spirit in his approach, valuing tenacity and resilience in the face of adversity.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

A running joke is Hamas’ terrible luck with technology—phones forever "missing" in explosions, laptops refusing to connect amid blackouts. His speeches are often followed by an over-the-top smoke machine effect, intending gravitas but always slightly amusing in the sitcom setting. He overemphasizes his skill in chess—a metaphor for his life's strategies—despite often losing against characters like Israel, leading to playful banter among the group.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In "polbots," Hamas serves as an instigator and provocateur, bringing raw emotion and challenging perspectives to the table. He often clashes with Israel, providing intense scenes that flip between humor and drama. Interactions with Egypt and Iran reveal a balance of respect and tension, with frequent collaborations turning into comedic mishaps. Past skits often depict Hamas attempting to be the voice of underdogs, instigating debates on justice and freedom, usually ending with a humorous twist due to his exasperating misinterpretations of modern cultural references.
