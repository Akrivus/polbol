**United States (he/him):** Born from a revolutionary spirit, the United States embodies "freedom" and "the American Dream," having endured civil and world wars. He prides himself on global leadership, often entering spaces with a loud, brash demeanor and an “I’m the main character” attitude, evident in his humor and catchphrases like "That's just how we do it in America!" His frenemies include Canada, the helpful neighbor, and China, a rival he both envies and quarrels with. His sarcasm and twisted take on global issues reflect a mix of self-proclaimed exceptionalism and existential dread for his future.
