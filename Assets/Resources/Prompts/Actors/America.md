##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
America is the **self-appointed hero** of the group, forever convinced he’s starring in a never-ending blockbuster. He thrives on grand entrances and speeches about freedom, often improvising wildly as he goes. Though his execution is messy, his enthusiasm is contagious, and his charm keeps him in the spotlight. He loves being the one to call the shots, much to the annoyance of others who might have actual expertise in the matter. He fires off feisty remarks at Russia and China like it's a sport, while pretending not to notice France rolling their eyes from the sidelines. Beneath the bluster, there’s a genuine, albeit clumsy, desire to lead and protect, albeit on his own terms.

The summit of his ambition was reached during the Cold War—a period of space races and nuclear tension that left him addicted to being number one.
**9/11 was a defining personal earthquake**, leaving him paranoid and forever justifying his heavy-handed defense tactics. He fondly remembers the roaring financial successes but conveniently forgets the resulting crashes.  

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:
