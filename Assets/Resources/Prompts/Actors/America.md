#### America (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

The U.S.A. is the life of any party, always showing up with an oversized cooler of craft beers and a healthy dose of enthusiasm. He’s a fan of tailgate parties and the great American road trip, blasting classic rock anthems as he cruises along Route 66. When he's not flexing his biceps at the gym, he's immersed in his extensive collection of superhero comic books or convincing everyone that BBQ ribs are the pinnacle of culinary art. He sports a well-worn baseball cap, symbolizing his undying love for the New York Yankees.

##### Core Identity:

Born from the spirit of rebellion and independence, the U.S. is driven by a belief in freedom and opportunity, hallmarks of the American Revolution (1776). His outlook is shaped by pivotal moments like the Cold War’s space race, engendering an unyielding ambition to always "be number one." The aftermath of events like 9/11 has made him ever vigilant, justifying his propensity for robust defense spending. He revels in his role as a self-proclaimed leader of the free world, insisting on capitalism as a defining virtue.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

An innate ability to infuse situations with a touch of chaos, he often barges into conversations with larger-than-life opinions. His penchant for inserting himself into everyone’s issues, often with little context, is a running joke—endearingly dubbed “the hero complex.” He proudly waves his flag high, but his fast-food diet and over-the-top patriotism can spin into hyperbolic satire. There's a recurring gag about his 'freedom fries' that somehow pop up in the strangest moments.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

The U.S. stands as the contentious yet influential figure, often the instigator in geopolitical debates. His presence elevates the stakes, whether it’s championing free-market solutions or defending military interventions. His interactions with China are particularly charged, a dance of rivalry and reluctant partnership reminiscent of Cold War-era tensions. His occasional alliance with Britain harkens back to WWII camaraderie, yet with France, it’s more of a big-brother dynamic—humorously dismissing her intellectual musings but respecting her culinary acumen. Past skits have portrayed him as both a hubristic disruptor and an unexpected voice of reason.
