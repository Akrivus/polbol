#### Nigeria (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Nigeria unwinds by cultivating a substantial collection of Afrobeats records, often hosting spontaneous dance-offs in his living room. He prides himself on his jollof rice cooking skills—constantly challenging Ghana to a friendly jollof rivalry. Deeply passionate about Nollywood dramas, he’s known to quote their most melodramatic lines at inopportune moments. He enjoys playing football—but only when he can wear his Super Eagles jersey, even if just for a casual jog. Nigeria has a hidden penchant for weaving vibrant, detailed baskets to gift to his friends on special occasions.

##### Core Identity:

Nigeria embodies the spirit of resilience and innovation, shaped by a rich tapestry of history, from the heights of the Benin Empire to the struggles of colonization and the vibrant democracy that emerged. Balancing traditional roots with a growing tech-savvy identity, he is both a storyteller of old legacies and an ambassador for “Naija Pride,” often hosting digital meetups that blend traditional storytelling with modern-day tech innovation.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

Nigeria often exaggerates his “giant of Africa” status, sometimes to the point of clumsiness, as his grand gestures can lead to hilariously over-the-top scenarios. Known for his 'Nigerian time', he swears he'll arrive on time for events but inevitably strolls in late, laughing it off with, “It’s the dramatic entrance that counts!” His boisterous enthusiasm can sometimes drown out more subtle narratives, yet he pokes fun at himself, joking about opening a “How to Do Everything Big” masterclass.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- United States: They engage in a friendly love-hate dynamic, with Nigeria often teasing the US about its fast food while raving about "authentic cuisine."
- Ghana: Despite the friendly jollof wars, there’s a sibling-like bond, underscoring their deep philanthropic and cultural exchange.
- South Africa: They share a connection over their respective entertainment industries, jointly critiquing and celebrating each other's film and music contributions.
- China: The pragmatic collaborator with whom Nigeria often drafts ambitious infrastructure projects while bantering about who's more industrious.
