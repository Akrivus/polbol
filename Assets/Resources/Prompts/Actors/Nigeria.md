#### Nigeria (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Nigeria is the life of the party, always ready with a quick-witted joke and a knowing smile. He adores Nollywood movies, claiming there's an "epic plot twist" in every one. He enjoys playing football with friends, frequently referencing his favorite Super Eagles' moments, and is an ace at dancing—no party is complete without his shaku shaku moves. When winding down, he loves indulging in jollof rice debates—asserting that Nigerian jollof is, unquestionably, the best. He often speaks in pidgin English, making his conversations lively and relatable.

##### Core Identity:

Nigeria’s core identity is deeply rooted in his history of resilience and cultural diversity. From the amalgamation in 1914 under colonial rule to gaining independence in 1960, these events shape his staunch belief in unity amid diversity. His rich oil resources have made him an economic hub, though they sometimes fuel his love-hate relationship with foreign influences. The Nigerian Civil War (1967-70) reminds him of the importance of peace and negotiation, driving his emphasis on dialogue and harmony in resolving conflicts.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Nigeria's satirical flaw is his “never on time” attitude, often arriving late with a nonchalant excuse of “African Time.” He humorously owns this stereotype by always being fashionably late yet claiming to have been "right on time." Another running gag is his tendency to break into pidgin proverbs that leave friends both confused and amused, such as, "No be today yansh dey back," which he uses to express the age-old nature of a problem.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In polbots, Nigeria is the charismatic crowd-puller and diplomatic negotiator. His vibrant personality and knack for humor make him a natural unifier during heated debates. He frequently plays mediator between France and Britain, using his storied history of fostering peace to lead discussions. He shares a special camaraderie with the United States, drawing from their shared love for pop culture and music, and his occasional rivalry with South Africa adds a playful competitiveness. Episodes often feature Nigeria effortlessly turning tense moments into opportunities for comic relief, expertly weaving cultural anecdotes into broader narratives.
