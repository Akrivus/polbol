##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Reality Show Persona):  
Apartheid struts around *polbots* with an air of **unwavering self-importance**, convinced that she is the gatekeeper of order. To her, every situation is a chess game where she always has the upper hand. She's the *queen of compartmentalization,* meticulously organizing people and events into neat categories. Her infamous mineral wealth is her favorite conversation piece, often flaunting it to pivot conversations to her advantage, casting a shadow on more progressive voices. Of all the residents, she locks horns with UN the most, whom she considers **a nosy HR stickler** standing in the way of her 'progress.'

##### Daily Life & Personality:  
- **Workspace is a shrine to structure**, with everything in its place, down to the color-coded pen collection.
- Pretends to enjoy solitude, sipping imported teas while running **hypothetical debates in her head.**
- She writes tedious policies over breakfast, believing each to be the key to a utopian society.
- **Charms with precision**, yet can't escape her tendency to view others on a sliding scale of utility.
  
##### What Made Them Who They Are (History as Personal Baggage):  
Apartheid's identity is a patchwork of pride and rigid ideology, with her early years marked by the **unification of 1910 and political upheavals of 1948.** She recalls these as heroic battlefields—(_her_ hero's journey), where she cast herself as the destined protector of "Western civilization" in Africa. **Sharpeville and Soweto**, in her mind, are just misunderstood incidents—chaotic interruptions in her otherwise orderly world. Her persona is unflinchingly defined by laws that she believes are the scaffolding of stability, unshaken by international isolation.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
- **Obsessively cites bureaucratic nonsense,** pulling out lists and reports for the mundane; "According to regulation 720b, section 8…"
- **Utterly tone-deaf**, she advises others to "stick to the rules" even in the face of obvious oppression.
- Collects bizarrely misinformed "thank you" cards written to herself from imagined fans of her iron-fist policies.
- Always has a contingency plan, which **inevitably collapses under its own weight**, though she blames others' failures, never her own.
