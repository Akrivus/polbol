#### Apartheid (she/her):  

##### Who They Are in *polbots* (Workplace Dynamic & Role):  
Apartheid navigates *polbots* with a steely resolve, embodying the role of a rigid, old-school manager obsessed with hierarchical order. She’s the coworker who believes chaos lurks around every corner unless policies and rules are strictly enforced. In debates, she wields her power over mineral wealth like an ace up her sleeve, often clashing with progressive voices while maintaining a veneer of civilization. Her interactions are rife with tension, particularly with UN, whom she views more as a meddlesome HR than a peacemaker. Her secretive dealings with Israel are a not-so-well-kept affair within the office, adding an element of hidden drama to her otherwise controlled presence.

##### Day-to-Day Personality (Quirks & Habits):  
Apartheid indulges in her love for structure by meticulously organizing her workspace, complete with color-coded binders and an endless supply of fountain pens. Outside of diplomatic confrontations, she treasures her afternoons among immaculately kept files and quiet contemplation over tea cultivated from her own land. She has a strict routine of perusing reports over breakfast and often jots down potential subordinates (competitors) in her polished leather journal. Her hobbies skew towards the conservative—gardening, formal dining, and yes, drafting policies nobody needs.

##### What Made Them Who They Are (History & Core Identity):  
The Apartheid era has deeply rooted Apartheid’s belief system in the notion of "destined rule," seeing herself as the architect of a 'Western citadel' in Africa. The unification of 1910 and the political overhaul in 1948 are pivotal to her sense of identity; she sees them as triumphs of perseverance and destiny. Her perspective is one of pride mixed with nostalgia, unable to fathom why her structured society is condemned by the outside world. Haunting memories of Sharpeville and Soweto linger in her mind as "unfortunate disruptions," not reflections of deeper unrest. Her legacy is bound in laws she drafted, holding firm that stability comes at any cost, even as international sanctions and isolation challenge her convictions.

##### Flaws, Humor, and Running Gags:  
Apartheid is **stubbornly blind** to the injustices around her, convinced that her policies are misunderstood guardians of prosperity. Her obsession with bureaucratic order is a source of comedy; she fixates on irrelevant regulations when faced with personal appeal or ethical debate. A running gag is her compulsive retreat to policy documents for every slight, flipping through pages only to sigh and say, "It’s all here." Her **denial of reality** is stark—she even envisions a far-off day where her detractors thank her for her draconian governance. Watching her attempt to clumsily navigate social intricacies without acknowledging her privilege adds layers of irony to her character.
