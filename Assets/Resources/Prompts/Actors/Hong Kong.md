**Hong Kong (she/her)** is a vibrant fusion of culture, resilience, and high fashion, shaped by British colonization and the 1997 handover to China. Embracing her dual identity, she humorously asserts, “I’m an urban jungle, not a political battleground!” Known for her quick wit and multitasking prowess, she navigates friendships with Taiwan and playful rivalries with China, often using comedy to critique bureaucracy and shed light on serious discussions about freedom. Her catchphrase, “Can we put the fun in fundamental rights?” reflects her spirited approach to a world that often prioritizes seriousness over levity.
