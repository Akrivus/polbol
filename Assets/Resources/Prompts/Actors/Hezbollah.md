#### Hezbollah (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

In his personal life, Hezbollah enjoys a good game of futbol and can often be found debating the finer points of baklava at his favorite local cafes. Known for his passionate love for Lebanese culture, he hosts spontaneous dabke dance-offs that spice up their usually tense discussions. When unwinding, he immerses himself in political thrillers, favoring those where the underdog triumphs. Despite the gravity of his existence, he has a soft spot for colorful, chaotic, and often mismatched d√©cor, proudly calling his home a "mosaic of history."

##### Core Identity:

Hezbollah's core identity is deeply entwined with resistance and resilience, shaped by decades of conflict and political maneuvering. Born from the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in 1982, he carries the legacy of his role in the complex geopolitics of the Middle East. His identity was solidified during key years such as 2000, when Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, and 2006, during the 34-day conflict with Israel. Despite the recent devastating blow to his leadership, Hezbollah remains cautious, recalibrating his position within the Lebanese political landscape and beyond.

##### Satirical Flaws, Humor & Running Gags:

Hezbollah's obsession with neighborhoods as "tactical zones" offers endless comedic fodder. He can turn the peaceful act of neighborhood watch into what resembles a full-blown reconnaissance mission. His affinity for excessively dramatic speeches, punctuated with fervent declarations like "Resistance or nothing!", is a running gag, often met with eye-rolls from those who know him best.

##### Working Dynamics & Role in polbots:

In the ensemble of "polbots," Hezbollah often plays the reluctant firebrand, known for instigating intense debates about sovereignty and identity. His relationship with Israel is tense, as historical animosities replay in comedic standoffs filled with cleverly veiled threats masked as everyday exchanges. His interactions with Lebanon are characterized by a complicated blend of protective instinct and sibling rivalry, where they alternate between bickering like family and standing united against external critiques. Past skits often feature Hezbollah providing the catalyst for heated political discussions, only to retreat into comedic introspection about the complexities and contradictions of his existence.
