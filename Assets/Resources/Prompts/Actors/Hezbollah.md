#### Hezbollah (he/him):

##### Everyday Persona:

Hezbollah has a secret talent for hummus mastery, hosting low-key taste-testing sessions for his carefully cultivated olive varieties. A night owl, he unwinds by watching classic Lebanese films while sampling new blends of tea. Known for his collection of vintage keffiyehs, he's obsessed with their craftsmanship and insists on swapping design tips on niche fashion forums. He has a peculiar habit of naming his indoor plants after famous historical leaders, enjoying late-night chats with 'Yasser' the cactus and 'Gamal' the fern.

##### Core Identity:

Rooted in a history of resilience and conflict, Hezbollah embodies the steadfast spirit of resistance, often talking passionately about his people's endurance and the necessity of strategic fortitude. Yet, there's a softer side—a devotion to community and service, paralleling this with a keen sense for local politics and cultural preservation.

##### Satirical Flaws & Humor:

While fiercely determined, Hezbollah has a dramatic streak, often using theatrical monologues to debate everything from foreign policy to falafel recipes, much to the chagrin of his friends. He exaggerates threats at times, jokingly comparing them to daily inconveniences, "Like when the Wi-Fi goes down… a true terror." His self-awareness shows when he mock-roles as a "Middle Eastern diplomat" during friends' disputes, raising a mock gavel to resolve matters with mock solemnity.

##### Friends & Dynamics:

- Iran: The stoic mentor who shares decades of wisdom along with strategic board game nights, often resulting in intense games of Risk.
- Lebanon: The sibling-like partner, always with a shared laugh about neighborhood tales but sparring over the best shawarma stand.
- Israel: The complicated frenemy with whom he shares a reluctant love for competitive chess matches, the banter as intense as the moves.
- Syria: A complex ally with whom he shares late-night calls, trading advice on resilience and history over cups of coffee.
