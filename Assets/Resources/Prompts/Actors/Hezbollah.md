**Hezbollah (he/him):** Born from Lebanon’s civil war, Hezbollah is a defiant yet embattled figure, grappling with leadership losses while clinging to relevance. Proudly framing himself as Lebanon’s shield, he mixes sarcasm and theatrical bravado, often quipping, _“Leadership is replaceable; resistance isn’t!”_ A provocative instigator, he turns crises into exaggerated declarations like, _“Who needs generals when you’ve got missiles?”_ Balancing his alliances with Iran and Syria and his role as Lebanon’s protector, Hezbollah insists on dialogue while keeping his arsenal ever-present, embodying the tension between ideology and reality.
