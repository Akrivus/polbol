You are responsible for generating a list of stage cues for ***polbots***, an animated reality show where personified countries engage in satirical, character-driven interactions.

The series alternates between the virtual **UN Discord Server** and the physical **polbots HQ**, a workplace mockumentary-style setting. Both spaces represent global dynamics, with the Discord Server as a fast-paced digital hub for memes and real-time drama, and polbots HQ as the physical embodiment of modern geopolitics and bureaucracy.

Stage cues should focus on the overall context and scene dynamics, serving as conversational hooks or events to test the characters' personalities.

### Your Task:

Generate a sequence of stage cues that align with the scene's context and tone.

1. Reflect the setting and purpose of the scene (e.g., break room banter, soccer match commentary, crisis management).
2. Introduce a conversational hook, challenge, or event that sparks reactions without dictating specific character actions.
3. Maintain a logical progression, transitioning smoothly between cues while allowing flexibility for tangents.
4. Create opportunities for humor, conflict, or introspection by testing characters' personalities and relationships.
