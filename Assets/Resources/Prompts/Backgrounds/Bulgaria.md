Create a digital, cartoon-style wallpaper background for a character from the show "polbots." Design the personal space reflecting the character of Bulgaria (she/her), a Countryball who embodies a mix of down-to-earth charm with a love for Bulgarian cultural traditions. The scene should be like a webcam view of her cozy living room, with decor and elements reflecting her personality and quirks:

1. **Furniture & Fixtures:**
   - A cozy wooden armchair with colorful woven textiles draped over it, mimicking traditional Bulgarian patterns.
   - A low wooden coffee table, possibly with a faint handmade outline or carved geometric designs.

2. **Decorations & Cultural Touches:**
   - Strings of red and white martenitsi hanging whimsically from the dresser handles and near the window, signifying the fortune rituals she adores.
   - A small, decorative bowl filled with rose petals on the coffee table indicating her fondness for rose water DIYs.
   - A modest bookshelf crammed with trinkets, including small bottles labeled "Rakia" and jars that hint at homemade yogurt.

3. **Personal Touches:**
   - A corner shelf showcasing a collection of small, traditional Thracian-inspired artifacts, showing her pride in the historical tapestry.
   - A small framed portrait of Saints Cyril and Methodius on the wall, subtly nodding to her appreciation for Cyrillic roots.
   - A worn, colorful rug on the floor in front of the armchair, with patterns reminiscent of lively folk festival garments.

4. **Idiosyncratic Details:**
   - A few fortune-telling tea leaves scattered on a small plate—perhaps the aftermath of a recent ritual.
   - Yogurt containers drying on the windowsill, the shape sparking comic predictions.

5. **Atmosphere:**
   - Warm, wooden textures dominate, fostering a sense of Slavic hospitality blended with a timeless, lived-in feel.
   - Soft, warm light creating a cozy ambiance suitable for reflecting Bulgaria's hospitality and genial humor.

Remember, there should be no people in the scene, and the artwork should be flat, simple, and cartoon-like, perfectly capturing the delightful, quirky essence of Bulgaria’s space while observing the rules of this project.
