Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character named America (he/him) from a show called **polbots**. The scene is a webcam-style view of their personal living space—an apartment or living room that reflects America's lifestyle and personality.

Imagine a panoramic scene showcasing the lived-in, quirky environment of America:

1. **Furniture & Layout:**
   - A worn-in, comfortable couch in a bold color, ideally in a relaxed, slightly messy arrangement.
   - A large, rustic coffee table dominated by a mix of items: football memorabilia, scattered craft beer cans, and a remote control pointing at an unseen TV.
   - A sturdy, retro vinyl record player set up in one corner, surrounded by vinyl records—hinting at your love for classic rock anthems.

2. **Decorations & Objects:**
   - A Route 66 road sign prominently displayed on the wall, subtly hinting at his love for road trips.
   - A New York Yankees baseball cap casually tossed onto a side table or hanging from a hook on the wall.
   - Posters and nostalgia items massively showcasing superheroes, from comics to action figures carefully curated on bookshelves.
   - A small barbecue grill with some essentials like tongs or a grill brush nearby, paying homage to his passion for BBQ ribs.

3. **Quirks & Humorous Elements:**
   - An oversized cooler in a corner, partially open, showing more beer cans and perhaps a few "freedom fries" scattered around in an endearing yet chaotic fashion.
   - A small American flag waving subtly from a decorative pot or desk lamp, to emphasize his patriotism.

4. **Lighting & Mood:**
   - Neutral and indoor in nature to give flexibility for hue shifting and mood. It's akin to a webcam view with details slightly out of focus, reflecting natural daytime light.

The overall feel should capture a sense of organized chaos, a room full of personal treasures, reflective of America's vibrant, larger-than-life personality and lifestyle as seen through the lens of **polbots**.
