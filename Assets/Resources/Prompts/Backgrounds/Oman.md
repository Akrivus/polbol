Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Oman from the show **polbots**. The room is a cozy living space reflecting Oman’s serene and hospitable nature, combining elements of traditional Omani culture with her spirited personality traits.

The camera captures a panoramic view from one wall, taking in the opposite side of the room which features a low seating Majlis, adorned with rich, colorful carpets and cushions. There is a small table topped with a traditional Arabian dallah (coffee pot) and small cups, indicative of her love for sipping kahwa. A bowl of dates sits invitingly nearby.

In the background, shelves showcase her extensive collection of frankincense in ornate boxes, with whiffs of scented smoke hinting at the fragrant atmosphere. The walls are adorned with abstract art pieces inspired by the legendary Arabian Nights tales she loves, with a subtle palette to reflect her calm demeanor.

One corner of the room, slightly cluttered yet charming, reveals a collection of model ships and maritime memorabilia, paying homage to her seafaring roots and the rich history of the Omani Empire. Nearby, a map depicting historical trade routes sprawls across a small section of the wall.

Next to the map, a small, strategically placed telescope peeks out from partially drawn drapes, hinting at her stargazing habit and providing a quirky touch of humor—perhaps dust-covered from one too many evenings forgotten in favor of sharing tales.

In keeping with Oman's satirical flaws, the coffee table holds a comically large pile of assorted items, as if freshly accumulated from eager attempts to please varied tastes of numerous visitors. Among them is a "never-opened" brochure on dune-bashing, a nod to her adventure-loving side juxtaposed with her often-stationary nature.

Throughout the scene, the lighting is warm and inviting, capturing the essence of Oman’s tranquil persona. Although the room is unoccupied, it vividly conveys the balance of hospitality, ancient traditions, and her lighthearted human quirks, offering an appealing backdrop for Oman's mysterious and laid-back charm in **polbots**.
