**Prompt for DALL-E:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper for a character's personal space viewed through a webcam in the show "polbots." Represent Algeria, a spirited Countryball, as a room filled with her vibrant and lively personality. The room should convey her love for Rai music, couscous, and antiques. 

Imagine a cozy living room adorned with lush indoor plants of various sizes, swaying gently as if they could hum along to a Rai tune. A decorative couscous bowl sits prominently on a wooden table, humorously larger than usual to hint at Algeriaâ€™s endless servings. On a nearby shelf, an antique radio hints at her musical passion, with old vinyl records leaning casually against it.

The furniture has both traditional and eclectic designs: a plush, oversized armchair sporting patterns reminiscent of North African textiles, a low-sitting couch with bright, spice-colored cushions, and a small, round rug with a medley of geometric patterns blending Amazigh, Arab, and Ottoman influences.

In one corner, an ornate tea set glimmers under a warm, ambient light, with a steaming cup of mint tea placed invitingly on a side table. Above, a framed tapestry depicting the Casbah of Algiers adds cultural depth and historical pride, while a small, humorous detail shows a tiny dusting of sand near the base of a potted plant, a nod to her desert tales.

The lighting is neutral, casting soft shadows that enhance the room's warmth, and the details should appear slightly blurred to mimic a webcam perspective. Ensure the space feels like a snapshot of Algeria's life, infused with a mix of humor, culture, and history. Keep style simple with flat shapes, avoiding realistic textures, and ensure no text appears within the scene.
