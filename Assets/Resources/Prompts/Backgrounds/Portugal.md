Title: Portugal's Cozy Seafaring Nook

Prompt: Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character named Portugal from the show "polbots." The scene is a panoramic webcam-style view of her cozy and charming personal space, resembling an inviting living room. The room should look lived-in but unoccupied, with a focus on reflecting Portugal's personality and cultural influences.

The background features:
- A comfortable plush armchair with a small side table beside it, holding a gently steaming cup of coffee and a few pastéis de nata on a decorative plate.
- A vintage record player in one corner, with a stack of Fado vinyl records nearby, subtly nodding to her love for music and melancholy reflection.
- Surfboards with colorful designs leaned against a wall, their presence highlighting Portugal's passion for surfing and the famous waves of Nazaré.
- A bookshelf brimming with a mixture of adventurous maritime history books and telenovela box sets, showing her penchant for storytelling and drama.
- A small flag of Portugal sits proudly on the bookshelf, symbolizing her patriotic pride and connection to her heritage.
- A window casting soft, natural light into the room, with sheer curtains billowing slightly, reveals a peaceful glimpse of the Lisbon coastline in the distance.
- A football (soccer ball) lightly tucked under the armchair, a playful reminder of her enthusiasm for the sport.
- A soft, plush rug sprawled across the wooden floor, adding warmth and comfort to the space.
- Potted plants scattered throughout, introducing a touch of nature and vibrant greenery to the room.
- A cork bulletin board on the wall adorned with pinned postcards and scenic photos from past travels, hinting at her adventurous spirit and nostalgic memories.

Ensure the scene is rendered in a lighthearted, cartoon style with flat shapes and simple details. The perspective must be natural, like a webcam view, with nothing overly realistic. Avoid any people or characters in the scene, and use neutral indoor lighting to maintain focus on environmental details that tell Portugal's story in an inviting, humorous, and culturally rich manner.
