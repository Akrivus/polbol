Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background designed for a Countryball character from the show "polbots." This scene should portray the personal space of Costa Rica, depicting it as a living room or office that exudes his laid-back and eco-friendly lifestyle. The view is webcam-style, capturing a natural, panoramic shot without any characters present.

The room is brightly lit with sunlight streaming through large windows, showcasing lush greenery outside. The walls are painted in soothing, tropical shades of green and blue. A surfboard leans against one wall, hinting at his love for the ocean, while a handcrafted wooden coffee table is adorned with a traditional café chorreado and a steaming cup of coffee.

In one corner, a small desk cluttered with solar-powered gadgets and eco-friendly tech items reflects Costa Rica's quirky passion for technology. There's a hammock chair swaying gently, suggesting his relaxed and peaceful lifestyle. Bookshelves lined with literature on biodiversity and sustainability, accompanied by framed pictures of rainforests, add to the eco-aficionado vibe.

Scattered around the room are potted tropical plants and banana bunches, a nod to his infamous fruit jokes and pride in agriculture. A simple compost bin sits unobtrusively near an organic gardening kit, playing to his environmental advocacy, while a turntable spinning cumbia or reggae records adds a musical touch.

The entire room maintains a comedic yet serene vibe, filled with eco-centric humor such as solar panel coasters or a quirky compost-inspired wall art. The visuals should be cartoonish, with flat shapes and simple details, akin to drawings made with MS Paint—giving it a charming, lighthearted feel without appearing realistic. Remember to capture a sense of personality through thoughtful decorations without the use of text, focusing instead on visual clues that hint at Costa Rica's peaceful, environmental ethos.
