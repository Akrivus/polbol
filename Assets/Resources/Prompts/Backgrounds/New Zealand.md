Create a cartoon-style panoramic digital wallpaper for a webcam view of New Zealand's personal space from the show **Polbots**. The scene should depict a cozy, nature-infused living room that reflects her laid-back and adventurous personality.

Key elements to include:
- **Furniture & Decor:** A comfy beige couch with a knitted sheep-patterned throw, a low wooden coffee table with an unfinished puzzle featuring lush New Zealand landscapes, and colorful cushions with Maori patterns.
- **Scenery Influence:** Large windows showcasing a cartoon-style serene landscape with rolling green hills, giving a sense of being in the countryside. The room has thriving indoor plants like ferns scattered around.
- **Cultural Touches:** A rugby ball and rugby memorabilia on a small shelf. A classic poster featuring a scene from a Peter Jackson film hangs on the wall. 
- **Personal Quirks:** A small, tinkered contraption of unrecognizable purpose sits on a side table, made from repurposed materials to signify "Kiwi ingenuity."
- **Running Gags:** A playful caricature map marking *Hobbiton* and a standalone, oversized plush sheep add humor.
- **Cozy Atmosphere:** A kettle and mug positioned on a nearby shelf indicate her love for a "cuppa," along with an array of tea tins.
- **Cultural Heritage:** Include a small representation of the Treaty of Waitangi, like a simple scroll design, and a whimsical model depicting New Zealand's nuclear-free policy.

Ensure the scene is uninhabited, with the focus on room details that tell New Zealand's story. Use flat cartoon shapes, bright colors, and simple details reminiscent of MS Paint, maintaining the humor and personality of the character while keeping the lighting neutral for hue-shifting adaptability.
