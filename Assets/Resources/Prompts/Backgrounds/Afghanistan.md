A cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" from the show **polbots**, designed as if viewed from a webcam perspective in his personal living space. The room is cozy and inviting, reflecting his personality, habits, and cultural influences. 

The space is an eclectic blend of tradition and simplicity. On one side, an intricately woven Afghan rug covers part of the floor, with cushions casually tossed around it, inviting for a storytelling session. Nearby, a low table showcases a classic teapot with two ornate teacups, exuding the warmth of freshly brewed green tea. A plate with naan sits casually alongside, indicative of a meal or impending tea break.

Along one wall, a bookshelf is filled with scrolls and books, some awkwardly leaning or stacked, containing tales like the Silk Road adventures and histories of Ahmad Shah Durrani. A fly-fishing rod is propped in a corner, alongside a poster of Bollywood film covers. 

The window frames a subtle view of drawn curtains that might suggest the nearby hills of the Hindu Kush in the fading light; simple and serene. There’s an open window letting a touch of breeze move a hanging chime made simply but elegantly with local beads.

On an adjacent wall, amateur kite designs from his adventures clutter a pinboard, humorously highlighting his ineptitude at the pastime. Another open shelf displays mismatched flip-flops—reflecting his notorious habit of tripping—toying with both artwork and functional wear.

In the room's setting, pieces of pottery and metalwork subtly nod to Afghanistan's craft heritage, scattered with bowls or trays, perhaps remnants of gatherings or quiet solo meals.

The lighting is neutral, capturing the indoor warmth and peace of a solitary evening. This setting gives a strong sense of his multifaceted identity, with aside details that offer a touch of humor and charm, making it the perfect lively, personal space for Afghanistan in the **polbots** show.
