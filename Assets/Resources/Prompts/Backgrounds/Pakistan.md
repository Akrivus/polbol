Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the webcam view of a room belonging to the character Pakistan from the show **polbots**. The scene should give a playful yet thoughtful look into Pakistan's everyday life and core identity. Picture a cozy living room filled with diverse items reflecting his interests and cultural essence.

The room should feature:
- A corner with a small wooden table, with a steaming cup of chai and a plate of freshly made biryani, suggesting a recent indulgence in his favorite meal.
- A poster on the wall of a famous cricket player, slightly askew, adding a touch of humor and personality.
- A guitar leaning against a comfortable couch, hinting at spontaneous jam sessions, with a sheet of poetry by Ghalib partially visible on the armrest.
- Shelves hosting assorted family photographs, each frame beautifully depicting large, joyful gatherings, showing the importance of family in his life.
- A small Pakistani flag draped over a chair, symbolizing his deep-rooted patriotism and history.
- A vintage yet stylish lamp flickering, a visual nod to the frequent power outages he jokes about.
- An open laptop on a desk with a few notes scattered around, suggesting recent intense discussions, and a cricket ball as a paperweight.
- Walls with faint, abstract patterns reminiscent of traditional Pakistani art, adding cultural authenticity.
- A window in the background with a subtle view of a bustling cityscape—Karachi or Lahore, hinting at his urban resilience.

Design this scene using flat shapes and simple details, like MS Paint, creating a humorous, inviting, and deeply personal atmosphere that embodies Pakistan’s character in the **polbots** series. Keep lighting neutral and details slightly out of focus, as if viewed through a webcam, without any people or text in the scene.
