Subject: A digital wallpaper background for Congo's personal space in "Polbots"

Prompt: Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper of Congo's personal space. This room is vibrant and filled with cultural influences reflecting her personality and lifestyle. The perspective is like a webcam view, showing a colorful, lively room without any people present.

The room features:

1. **Dance and Music Elements**: Include a small stereo or vintage vinyl player with colorful vinyl records scattered around. A pair of traditional Congolese drums are placed prominently, hinting at her love for dance and rhythm. A disco ball hangs playfully from the ceiling, casting subtle, colorful reflections on the walls.

2. **Cultural Heritage**: A wall adorned with intricate, hand-crafted beaded decorations and masks reminiscent of her tribal heritage. On a side table, there are supplies for jewelry-making, with beads and strings neatly organized.

3. **Culinary Touches**: A cozy kitchenette area where a simmering pot of moamb√© chicken is depicted, steam gently rising. Nearby, a small stack of cookbooks with colorful covers suggests her culinary prowess.

4. **Historical Resonance**: A framed image of the Kingdom of Kongo and a small statue of Lumumba are displayed on a shelf, signifying her deep historical roots and love for storytelling.

5. **Humor and Quirks**: A playful cluster of "misplaced" modern gadgets like a tablet or phone, lightly covered in dust or tucked in humorous spots (like inside a conga drum or under a plant), illustrating her humorous disbelief in relying on technology.

6. **Unity Symbolism**: Various small items shared with Nigeria, such as a vibrant shared art piece or twin music instruments, reflecting their collaborative synergy within the show.

7. **Live-in Comforts**: Comfortable seating with boldly patterned, traditional African textiles throws over them. A few indoor plants add a touch of greenery, while the floor is partially covered with a vibrant, geometric-pattern rug.

This scene captures Congo's dynamic persona, her rich cultural background, and her humorous quirks with flat shapes and simple cartoon details. Ensure the lighting is neutral, while allowing for hue adjustments to match different moods.
