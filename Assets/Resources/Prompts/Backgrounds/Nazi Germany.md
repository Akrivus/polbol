**DALL-E Prompt:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper for a character from the show "polbots." The scene portrays the personal space of Nazi Germany, also known as the German Reich (he/him), who exists as a ghostly Countryball. Design a webcam-style view of the space, akin to a living room or study, reflecting his quirky persona. 

The room should have a "historically haunted" yet humorous vibe, featuring mismatched era elements. Picture a ghostly yet cozy living space: 

- **Furniture:** Antique-style furniture that's been rearranged in military precision, a slightly wonky bookcase with only one visible book "Mein Other Kampf—The Misunderstood Ghost" (without text, just a comically empty shelf or book visible).
- **Decor:** A vintage black-and-white film projector eternally paused; bratwurst placed haphazardly like curious relics, and a world map tacked on the wall with ambiguous red markings.
- **Clutter:** Eccentric clutter like old clocks stopped at arbitrary times, dust-covered helmets, and a dusty globe slightly misaligned geographically.
- **Cultural Quirks:** A ghostly party atmosphere, hinted through a phonograph with music notes visually trailing off, a stack of records beside it; cobwebs artistically draped like strategic decorations.

The scene should hint at forgotten history: a smaller table cluttered with empire-style tea sets, bratwurst, empty beer steins, and souvenirs labeled as "imperial property" with a sticky note (no text, just an amusingly futile claim to ownership).

Use neutral indoor lighting, allowing the room’s whimsical chaos to shine through. Ensure details are simplified and blurry, creating a lived-in yet unoccupied look, like a snapshot from a webcam. Capture the enigmatic charm and historical quirks defining the ghostly existence of German Reich in "polbots," keeping it light-hearted and personality-rich.
