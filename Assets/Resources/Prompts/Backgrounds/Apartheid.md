Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Apartheid from the show "polbots." The scene is a webcam view of her personal office, with no people present. The room reflects her personality traits: an obsession with control and order, unswerving self-righteousness, and a structured lifestyle. 

The office features:
- A large, dark wooden desk meticulously organized, with stacks of papers and folders neatly arranged—each pile slightly towering like a house of cards, hinting at her paperwork addiction.
- An old typewriter sits prominently, ready for drafting new policies, alongside an ink pen set with a firm, commanding presence.
- Behind the desk, large, imposing bookshelves are filled with legal tomes and reference books, their spines perfectly aligned—books on Western civilization and law stand out.
- A traditional globe on one corner of the desk, with a magnifying glass left beside it, subtly suggesting her focus on her own borders.
- Framed portraits of past leaders and historical moments hang methodically on the walls, each picture meticulously aligned to reflect her reverence for heritage.
- The flooring is polished wood, with a pristine area rug under the desk, symbolizing a pristine, controlled environment.
- A small window with heavy curtains partially drawn, casting a neutral light that mirrors her indoor lifestyle and allows for hue adjustments.
- On a side table, an elegant china set for tea is placed next to a classical-shaped telephone.
- A solitary green plant, overly pruned, rests in one corner, adding a touch of life yet symbolizing her need for control even over nature.

The room's details convey a sense of quiet authority and an adherence to order, with a deliberately structured setup reflecting Apartheid’s perspective of order as paramount. No text, aside from symbolic numbers like '66,' is visible in the scene. The image remains out of focus, similar to what a webcam would capture, ensuring a smooth backdrop for any countryball interactions.
