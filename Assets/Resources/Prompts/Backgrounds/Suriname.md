Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Suriname from the show **polbots**. The scene should feature a cozy and vibrant living room reflecting Suriname's lifestyle and personality. Picture a webcam-style view capturing the room in a wide, panoramic perspective, showcasing various elements that speak to Suriname's laid-back and multicultural essence:

1. **Furniture & Layout:**
   - A comfortable, slightly worn hammock swings gently by the large, open window that reveals lush greenery outside, symbolizing Suriname's love for late-night jungle walks.
   - A small, wooden coffee table cluttered with a plate of roti, a glass of Borgoe rum, and a radio playing bright, festive kaseko music.
   - Soft, colorful cushions scatter around the floor, inviting a casual, relaxed atmosphere.

2. **Décor & Objects:**
   - Walls adorned with a few framed, stylized bird illustrations, hinting at Suriname's bird-watching hobby.
   - A well-loved cricket bat and football lean against one wall, symbols of Suriname's sporting interests.
   - A bookshelf full of eclectic novels, with room for a few potted plants sneaking in vibrant green foliage, showing his passion for storytelling and nature.

3. **Cultural Touches:**
   - A small Javanese mask and an Afro-Surinamese drum positioned subtly in corners, representing the rich multicultural tapestry Suriname embraces.
   - A decorative rainstick on a shelf, mirroring the running gag of Suriname summoning tropical rainstorms.

4. **Quirky Details:**
   - A cozy corner with a low table, partially obscured by jungle leaves, that features a half-finished learn-Dutch language book, Suriname's humorous nod to his satirical flaw.
   - An old-fashioned rain gauge by the window, tying to his catchphrase, “Rain’s good for the sasi kura!”

5. **Humorous Elements:**
   - A fridge door subtly peeking into view with a magnet shaped like a jungle hut, adding a touch of Suriname's rustic charm.
   - A quirky wall clock set at a slightly different time, suggesting Suriname's habit of zoning out.

Overall, the room should feel vividly colorful, filled with flat shapes and simple details, creating a space that embodies Suriname's easygoing, yet deeply cultural and humorous spirit, without becoming an explicit representation of the Suriname country. All elements should be in a cartoonish style to maintain the whimsical nature of the **polbots** series.
