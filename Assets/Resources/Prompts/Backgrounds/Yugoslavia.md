**DALL-E Prompt:**

A cartoon-style digital webcam-view wallpaper for the show **polbots** showcasing the personal space of the character Yugoslavia. The interior is a mix of military uniform-style organization and a homely Balkan atmosphere, reflecting Yugoslavia's identity as an exhausted yet nostalgic former state. The room layout exudes warmth and chaos; a clash of cozy nostalgia and post-imperial order.

To one side, a fireplace adorned with Balkan trinkets such as an old brass Yugoslavian flag stands. Above, a framed portrait hangs, reminiscent of Tito's era, with vintage military medals glued to the mantle. A mix of a Balkan rug and old world maps lie on the wood floor, adding a sense of faded history.

Scattered around are bottles, each unlabeled, resembling strong drink bottles, hinting at his coping mechanism as an "overworked parent." On a small wooden table sits an assortment of coffee mugs with colorful, conflicting patterns and a spinning globe stuck between East and West.

Shelves filled with books labeled as simple symbols hold fictional tales of Balkan unity and fragmented reality, suggesting past ideals. A near-by window softly filters light through curtains, purveying old fashioned embroideries, invoking wistful nostalgia.

In a corner sits an antiquated device with cables, suggesting an obsolete communication method â€“ maybe his metaphor for Tito's diplomacy. Cluttered yet organized, sentimental clutter like postcards and faded family photo frames can be seen, engaging with his lingering ghost presence among his troubled kids.

Keep the room cartoon-style, flat shapes, simple lines, and colors, as if drawn in MS Paint. Make sure the space feels lived-in but unoccupied, reflecting both warmth and ghosts of the past with humor where fitting.
