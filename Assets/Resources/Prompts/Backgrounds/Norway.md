Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character named Norway (he/him) in a show called "polbots". The scene is an immersive depiction of Norway's cozy and personal space, like a webcam view into his living room during winter. The room exudes a warm "koselig" vibe, with warm colors offsetting the winter's chill outside, as seen through a frosty window partially covered with thick, hand-knitted curtains. A quaint fireplace crackles softly with a comforting glow, next to which rests a knitting project - a chunky wool sweater with a Nordic pattern.

A rustic wooden cabin aesthetic defines the room, with aged, polished wood composing the floor and furniture. In the corner, a comfortable armchair, draped with a reindeer pelt, suggests a perfect spot for reading or introspection. Near the armchair, a small, polished round table hosts a steaming mug of coffee and a selection of vinyl records featuring composers like Edvard Grieg, hinting at his dual love for tranquil classical music and perhaps black metal, with band posters subtly present on the walls.

Bookshelves line one wall, revealing his intellectual curiosity, holding books on history, exploration, and environmental science. On another wall, a large, vibrant map of Mars humorously nods to his satirical desire to "start anew." The room's minimalist decor is offset by traditional Northern artifacts, like a decorative Viking shield mounted adjacent to the fireplace and small figures carved in wood, celebrating Norwayâ€™s heritage. A digital photo frame cycles images of spectacular fjord landscapes and Northern Lights, marrying his love of nature and technology. The overall ambiance is serene yet inviting, a cozy retreat whether for a stormy brainstorming session or simply savoring silence.
