**Prompt for DALL-E:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background depicting a personal room for the character Equatorial Guinea from the show "polbots." The room should appear as if it is seen through a webcam, from one wall facing another, capturing the essence of Equatorial Guinea's lifestyle and quirks. Use a panoramic, full-width image without any borders or negative space. The style should be simple and cartoonish, reminiscent of MS Paint, focusing on flat shapes and bright colors. 

**Room Details:**

1. **Furniture & Layout:**
   - Cozy corner with a wicker chair draped in a colorful, patterned cloth, evoking Equatorial Guinea’s love for vibrant textiles.
   - A wooden table set with a teapot and a beautifully painted ceramic teacup, symbolizing her fondness for biléku tea.
   - Bookshelves filled with culturally significant books, hinting at Fang and Bubi traditions.
   - A small music player or boombox in a corner, quietly pulsating imaginary beats of kotó music.

2. **Decorations & Personal Touches:**
   - Walls adorned with posters displaying traditional music and dance scenes like the balélé.
   - Hanging mobiles or artwork depicting lush rainforest scenes and native birds, reflecting her passion for nature and bird-watching.
   - A glass jar filled with marbles, hinting at her love for the game chilola.
   - A colorful rug that pulls the room together with tropical-themed patterns.

3. **Lighting & Overall Ambiance:**
   - The scene is lit with a warm, neutral indoor light, perfect for webcam viewing.
   - Soft, out-of-focus details hinting at laughter and light-heartedness, without overcrowding the room.

4. **Humor and Satirical Elements:**
   - Subtle humorous addition of a mini trophy labeled with simple numbers ‘68,’ nodding to her declaration of independence year.
   - Exaggeratedly large TV screen partially hidden behind an elaborate, Spanish soap-opera esque decorative fan, capturing her love for Spanish dramas.

Remember, no people or characters should appear in the scene, no text apart from allowed symbols or numbers, and the perspective should feel natural and cozy. The room should radiate Equatorial Guinea’s personality and cultural background while providing a humorous and insightful peek into her life.
