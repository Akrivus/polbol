Design a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character named Panama from the show "polbots". This is a webcam-style view of Panama's personal space, reflecting his laid-back demeanor and vibrant cultural background. Imagine a cozy living room with the following elements to convey his personality:

1. **Hammock by the Window**: A colorful hammock sways gently by a large, open window that hints at a warm tropical breeze. The window offers a glimpse of lush greenery outside, possibly a distant canal scene.

2. **Birdwatcher’s Corner**: A cluttered corner with binoculars casually placed on a small shelf, a sketchbook open with doodles of birds, and a book titled “The Harpy Eagle and Other Birds of Panama”.

3. **Salsa Dance Elements**: The floor has a pair of worn-out salsa dance shoes tossed casually, a record player in one corner with colorful vinyl records stacked, many of them labeled with vibrant colors hinting at salsa and Latin tunes.

4. **Cocktail Relaxation Spot**: A small side table with a freshly-made "Siesta" cocktail, complete with a cocktail umbrella, next to a lounging chair that sports a colorful throw inspired by indigenous patterns.

5. **Playful Canals Humor**: A quirky, oversized clock on the wall humorously themed as a canal lock, with hour markers resembling small ships, possibly stuck at "mañana" time—a nod to his procrastination joke.

6. **Cultural Blend Decoration**: Walls adorned with vibrant masks, artifacts that blend Indigenous, African, and Spanish influences, giving the space an eclectic, multicultural vibe.

7. **Subtle Nod to Traditions**: A small table with a decorative pottery piece depicting a canal scene, a symbol of Panama’s pride in global trade, yet playfully exaggerated with miniature ships atop it.

The room should exhibit cartoon simplicity with flat shapes and be unoccupied, symbolizing Panama’s vibrant yet relaxed lifestyle, characterized by an eagerness for music, dance, and nature. The aesthetic is humorous yet culturally rich, ideal for the character Panama in "polbots".
