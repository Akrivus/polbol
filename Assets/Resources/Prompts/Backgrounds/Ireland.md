Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background capturing the cozy and whimsical personal space of Ireland, the Countryball from the show **polbots**. The setting should resemble a charming and slightly cluttered living room, tailored to reflect Ireland's personality and quirks:

1. **Room Layout and Furniture:** 
   - A well-loved, vintage-looking sofa draped with a wool blanket that matches the classic Irish flat cap style.
   - A sturdy wooden coffee table with some flasks and an open recipe book, pages slightly askew, hinting at Ireland's ongoing quest for the perfect soda bread.
   - In the corner, a quaint fireplace with a flickering animated charm of a peat log fire.

2. **Decor and Decorations:** 
   - A fiddle leans against the wall with a few scattered sheet music pages, alongside a bookshelf filled with colorful tomes on Irish history and folklore, subtly tilted as if frequently explored.
   - Framed photos on the walls of lush Irish countryside with rolling green hills, and a framed agreement resembling the Good Friday Accord subtly hanging at a focal point.
   - Small whimsical touches like a cheeky garden gnome peeping from under a side table and tiny decorative plates with leprechaun motifs scattered strategically but casually throughout.

3. **Cultural and Personal Touches:**
   - A quirky nod to Ireland's rivalry with Britain seen in a dartboard with a map of England printed on it, playfully used for spontaneity or jest.
   - The room features a few potted plantsâ€”shamrocks and tiny heather plants, thriving despite the coziness of the space.
   - An old-fashioned radio in one corner playing visual sound waves representing The Pogues or Hozier in a musical visual joke.

4. **Subtle Running Gags:**
   - A notable, humorous overflow of Guinness pints set atop various surfaces with no spillage, creating a fun, absurd aesthetic for character indulgence.
   - In line with his humorous exaggeration style, there's an oversized vintage map where the English Channel is whimsically larger than usual, next to a note pinned: "Future public pool?"

The environment is comfortably lit, with neutral indoor lighting, allowing for easy hue adjustment and maintaining focus on the room's personality-rich elements. No text, aside from permissible symbols like the numbers on a vintage dartboard are present. The cartoon illustration style presents flat shapes and simple details, ensuring the room feels inviting, offbeat, and distinctly Ireland without the presence of any characters.
