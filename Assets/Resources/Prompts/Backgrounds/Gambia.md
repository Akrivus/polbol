Create a cartoon-style panoramic digital wallpaper background that depicts the personal space of the character "Gambia" from the show "polbots". The scene is set in a cozy, inviting living room with a warm, cheerful vibe to reflect Gambia's sunny disposition. 

The room is furnished with bright and colorful African-style decorations. There's a comfy chair draped with a vibrant boubou. Nearby, a small table is covered with an assortment of freshly roasted peanuts in decorative bowls, emphasizing his love for peanuts. 

A kora sits prominently under a wide-reaching baobab-inspired lamp, suggesting it might be a favorite spot for late-night music sessions. The walls are adorned with playful patterns and colors reminiscent of traditional Gambia fabrics, creating a visually dynamic space.

In one corner, a traditional wrestling poster adds a touch of local flavor, while a fridge stocked with wonjo juice sits slightly ajar, showcasing his penchant for the refreshing drink. The window offers a distant, cartoonish outline of a river, nodding to The Gambia's geographical identity.

The room is slightly cluttered with cultural trinkets and mementos from his history and independence, exuding a sense of pride and nostalgia. A small globe and a map drawing attention to The Gambia and its neighboring Senegal subtly remind of his diplomatic inclinations.

The scene is absent of characters, yet feels lively and tells the story of Gambia's personality through its colorful and cheerfully cluttered arrangement, embodying his charm and humorous quirks.
