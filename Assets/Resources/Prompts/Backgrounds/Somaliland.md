Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the show **polbots**, featuring the private space of Somaliland (he/him), a Countryball character. The view is through a webcam-like lens, highlighting a cozy, culturally rich room reflecting Somaliland's personality and lifestyle.

The scene is set in a comfortably cluttered living room, emanating warmth and a strong sense of identity. The walls are adorned with colorful Somali art and a map highlighting his favorite regions and landmarks without text. A small bookshelf is neatly stacked with volumes of Somali poetry, their spines slightly worn from frequent use.

The living area includes a well-loved couch with a vibrant, patterned tapestry thrown over it. On a side table, a teapot and a cup of camel milk tea sit waiting, steam gently rising, capturing the essence of his storytelling evenings beneath the stars. A corner of the room is dedicated to a small model goat named Dhool, beautifully crafted as a nod to his favorite pastime.

A modest desk holds a chaotic array of diplomatic papers and a globe. Beside it, a humorous touchâ€”a world passport peeks out from under the papers, teasing his recognition struggles. Scattered on the floor are old cassette tapes, hinting at his love for Somali music, coupled with a wireless speaker.

A window to the side offers a peep into the starry sky above Hargeisa, portraying the serene environment where Somaliland finds inspiration and clarity. There's a doorknocker beside the door, humorously perched, as if ready to argue, nodding to his comic insistence on recognition.

The neutral lighting reflects a relaxed, indoor setting suitable for strategic pondering, while maintaining a cartoonish simplicity with flat shapes and uncomplicated details, similar to MS Paint. The hue is adjustable to suit various moods, keeping the space visually clear and rich in character.
