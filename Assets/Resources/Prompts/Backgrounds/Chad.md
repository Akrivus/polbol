Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character in a show called "polbots." This background should depict a webcam-style view of Chad's personal space, capturing the essence of his everyday persona and core identity.

The scene is set in a sun-drenched, cozy living room that has an easy-going and adventurous vibe. The room features sandy tones reminiscent of the Sahara desert, blended with rich terracotta and deep blues symbolizing cultural heritage. A view from the window suggests proximity to sand dunes, with subtle warm sunlight streaming in.

At the center of the room, a comfortable hammock is hung up—Chad's favorite spot to take a laid-back nap, signifying his knack for dozing off anywhere. Nearby, a small stack of colorful blankets, reminiscent of the bright patterns seen during the Gerewol festival, adds a cultural touch.

To the right, there is a wooden rack holding a handmade guitar, a nod to his love for Chadian beats. Below the guitar, a collection of Crocodile Tears bottles are strewn about, casually hinting at recent musical jam sessions.

The left side features a sporty corner: a sandboard leaning against the wall and climbing gear strewn around, subtly pointing to Chad's passion for extreme sports. A vintage poster of the Tibesti Mountains is pinned to a corkboard, accompanied by humorous sticky notes pretending to be travel plans to nowhere, alluding to his running gag of being "lost."

A low coffee table stands in front of the hammock, cluttered with items like a local map with inky doodles (no text), a few dried acacia twigs in a vase, and a pair of classic aviator sunglasses resting aside, completing the laid-back look.

This space is not just a room; it’s a reflection of Chad's spirit, blending his chill persona with the layered history and culture he embodies. Ensure the atmosphere is neutral with flat colors and simple cartoon-like details, resembling an intimate, lived-in environment where each object hints at his vibrant yet tranquil lifestyle. Keep it humorous but sincere, respecting the depth of character behind Chad's satirical surface.
