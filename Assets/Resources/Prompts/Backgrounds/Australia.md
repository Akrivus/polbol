- In the corner, a classic surfboard leans against the wall, bright colors reminiscent of Bondi Beach, indicating his passion for surfing.
- The room's focal point is a large television screen paused on an iconic scene from an old Crocodile Dundee movie, a nod to his favorite pastime.
- The walls are adorned with framed posters of historical cricket matches and Australian rules football legends.
- A cozy nook with a small bookshelf holds a mix of camping gear and books on multicultural history, reflecting his adventurous and inclusive spirit.
- A pair of flip-flops are haphazardly kicked off near the door, showcasing his casual approach to life.
- A light-sensitive plant, shaped like a cartoonishly menacing animal, sits on the windowsill as a humorous nod to his satirical battle with Australia's wildlife.
- The neutral lighting casts soft shadows, capturing the carefree, easygoing essence of the space, inviting viewers to relax and unwind.

This cluttered yet vibrant environment is perfect for Australia, capturing his essence and open-hearted outlook.
