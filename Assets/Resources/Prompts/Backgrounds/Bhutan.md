A well-used bow and a target rest in the corner, humorously adorned with bulls-eye stickers.

A low wooden table in the center hosts an assortment of colorful mugs, one steaming with butter tea, and a plate of fiery red Ema Datshi, whimsically depicted with cartoon flames. Nearby, a small, open shelf cradles a collection of Bollywood DVDs, seemingly ready for a binge-watching session.

The floor is a mosaic of traditional Bhutanese rug designs, each square capturing a different folklore theme. Soft cushions are strewn about, inviting relaxation and storytelling.

To the side, a quaint bookshelf holds a mixture of spiritual texts and hydropower manuals, tongue-in-cheek referencing Bhutan's comedic love for hydropower. A potted Himalayan plant thrives in the background, symbolizing his connection to nature and sustainability.

The room's design, with its serene color palette and quirky elements, reflects Bhutan's peaceful yet subtly comedic persona. The panoramic view and simple cartoon details encapsulate the spirit of "polbots," inviting viewers to imagine Bhutan's contemplative life off-screen, full of cultural richness and tranquil humor.
