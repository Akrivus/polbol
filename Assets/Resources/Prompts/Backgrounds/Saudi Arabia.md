Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Saudi Arabia from the show "polbots." This personal space—perhaps a luxurious apartment or opulent office—should be depicted as a webcam-style view, appearing lived-in but unoccupied. The room should vividly reflect Saudi Arabia's pride in his Bedouin roots and modern lifestyle, showcasing a blend of tradition and extravagance with a humorous twist.

The design should include:

1. **Luxurious Elements**: Include a plush, ornate couch draped with a traditional Arabian rug alongside a high-tech gaming chair near a sleek, contemporary desk. A lavish coffee table prominently features a vase of fresh desert flowers, perhaps illuminated by an elegant golden lamp that suggests warmth and hospitality.

2. **Cultural Influences**: A decorative shelf holds miniature falcons, a nod to his passion for falconry, with a jeweled chess set hinting at his competitive nature. Camel figures strategically match his love for racing and desert gatherings.

3. **Modern Meets Traditional**: The wall art captures the juxtaposition of Riyadh’s skyline and ancient sand dunes, symbolizing his transition from past to future. Stylish curtains mimic the patterns of traditional Bedouin tents, framing not a window but perhaps a digital display offering soothing desert vistas.

4. **Quirky Details and Humor**: Carelessly strewn are his shining, jewel-encrusted sunglasses—a nod to his forgetful nature—and a flashy flashlight, placed near a solar-powered charger, echoing his humorous reliance on oil. A partially open sustainability magazine sits atop all.

5. **Personal Touches**: Add a small collection of mint condition oil cans and a set of camel-milk latte mugs with falafel crumbs on a side table. One can even find visionary city blueprints rolled up next to the desk.

6. **Neutral Lighting with Personality**: Reflect an indoor atmosphere with neutral lighting suitable for hue shifting, allowing a cheerful yet luxurious ambiance.

This panoramic room with cartoon stylings should encapsulate Saudi Arabia's character, portrayed with flat shapes and simple lines akin to MS Paint, bringing to life the character's opulent yet endearing quirks without adding people or text.
