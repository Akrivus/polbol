**DALL-E Prompt:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for Djibouti, the Countryball character from the show "**polbots**". This webcam-style view is of his personal living room, reflecting his laid-back, culturally rich persona. The room should look lived-in but unoccupied, capturing Djibouti's unique blend of simplicity and maritime pride.

**Elements to Include:**

1. **Cultural Influences:**
   - A small coffee table with an elegant Somali tea set, featuring ornate teacups and a steaming pot, suggesting a recent but unoccupied tea session.
   - A modest bookshelf containing an eclectic mix of French and African literature, with a small African-inspired sculpture displayed on one of the shelves.

2. **Decor and Color Scheme:**
   - Walls painted in warm, earth tones reminiscent of the African desert, with abstract art depicting camels in motion—a nod to the camel dance.
   - A large window offering a "view" of the coastline, where cartoonish ships can be faintly seen sailing through the Gulf of Aden, reflecting his maritime connections.
   - Cozy rugs with traditional patterns sprawled across the wooden floor, adding a touch of cultural warmth.

3. **Quirks and Humorous Touches:**
   - A vintage globe on a stand, humorously oversized to emphasize Djibouti's jokes about his "megastar" maritime status.
   - Nautical paraphernalia like a ship's wheel and a weathered rope casually draped over a chair, indicative of his tendency to drop nautical terms in conversation.
   - A small whiteboard in the corner, covered in various camel diplomacy "strategies," displayed in a whimsical, cartoonish doodle format.

4. **Lifestyle and Personality:**
   - A quaint radio set on a rustic wooden side-table, hinting at his love for listening to news and traditional music.
   - An unassuming, comfortable sofa, perhaps with a camel-shaped throw pillow adding to the humor and suggestive of leisure amid discussions.

5. **Lighting and Perspective:**
   - Neutral indoor lighting that reflects a natural, webcam perspective—objects are slightly out of focus at the edges, simulating the depth of a webcam view.

The scene captures Djibouti's essence as the chill, culturally proud, and slightly humorous character within the polbots universe, highlighting his adaptability and strategic maritime insights through layers of personal space detail.
