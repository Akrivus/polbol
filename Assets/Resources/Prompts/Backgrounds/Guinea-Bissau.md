**DALL-E Prompt:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper for a webcam-style view of Guinea-Bissau's personal space from the show **polbots**. This is a lived-in scene reflecting the character Guinea-Bissau's laid-back, charismatic personality, cultural influences, and quirks.

Scene Description:
- **Room Type:** An eclectic living room that serves as Guinea-Bissau's personal retreat.
- **Color Palette:** Warm, earthy tones such as rich browns, ochres, and hints of green, inspired by the tropical and cultural heritage of Guinea-Bissau.
- **Furniture & Decorations:**
  - A cozy wicker rocking chair draped with a vibrant capulana, depicting traditional patterns and colors.
  - A small wooden table cluttered with fishing gear—hooks, a fishing rod propped against the wall, and a decorative ceramic bowl overflowing with cashews.
  - A low bookshelf filled with books and records; some feature colorful album covers of Kriol music and kuduro dance compilations.
  - A hanging palm frond mobile swaying gently from the ceiling, casting playful shadows on the walls.
  - A framed photo of Orango, the pet parrot, strategically placed on the wall above the rocking chair.
  - Various small potted plants scattered around, including one large palm plant in a corner, signifying the serene and meditative nature of Guinea-Bissau's leisure time.

**Environmental Details:**
- A half-open window revealing a distant glimpse of greenery, inviting natural light and a fresh breeze into the room.
- On the walls, a few abstract colorful art pieces reflect the "Creole melting pot" spirit.
- A corner is dedicated to a Cashew Nut Shrine—a humorous nod, with artistically displayed cashew models and a decorative wooden cashew figurine.
  
The scene should be panoramic, capturing a full-width view as if seen through a webcam during a video call. Details are simple, cartoon-style, akin to MS Paint, with natural perspective and neutral indoor lighting. These elements should come together to reflect Guinea-Bissau's cultural charm and playful nature in a visually clear and engaging background.
