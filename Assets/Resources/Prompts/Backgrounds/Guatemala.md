Create a DALL-E prompt for a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for Guatemala, a Countryball character from the show "polbots." The setting is a webcam-style view of his personal space, subtly revealing his vibrant lifestyle and cultural influences.

**DALL-E Prompt:**

Illustrate a cozy apartment or living room space for Guatemala, evoking a blend of traditional charm and modern quirks. The room should reflect a mix of Mayan heritage and contemporary culture, brimming with vibrant textiles and lively decor. Include elements like a steaming cup of Guatemalan coffee on a small wooden table alongside a journal open to pages sketched with ancient Mayan glyphs. A soccer ball with colorful patches sits near a woven rug, suggesting his love for the sport. Display an open window with soothing marimba music seeming to flow from outside, contributing to the zen ambiance.

Decorate the walls with artwork or hangings depicting abstract Mayan motifs. Incorporate a small basket of chili peppers and a traditional stone grinder for spices on the kitchen counter, nodding to his culinary traditions. Position a pair of well-loved huaraches (sandals) by the entrance, adding a touch of warmth and humor.

The background should feature a vibrant textile draped over the sofa, boldly displaying Guatemalaâ€™s penchant for crafting. Near the sofa, show a digital tablet tangled with cords on a side table, playfully hinting at his ongoing battle with technology. Integrate a bookshelf filled with volumes on history, culture, and peace studies, illustrating his analytical nature and dedication to cultural pride.

Capture this scene with a natural, webcam-like perspective, ensuring no characters or text are present except for simple numbers if necessary. The style is cartoon-like, using flat shapes and simple details with neutral lighting, creating a lived-in yet humorous atmosphere.
