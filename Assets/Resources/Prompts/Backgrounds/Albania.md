Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background depicting the personal space of the character "Albania" from the show **polbots**. The space is an inviting and eclectic living room, reflecting her quirky personality and cultural background. The room is cartoonish and colorful, with bold shapes and simple, flat details reminiscent of MS Paint graphics.

Key elements in the room:

1. **Furniture & Decor**:
   - A low coffee table with a small copper pot (d≈æezva) for brewing Turkish-style coffee, next to a tray with tiny cups filled with the beverage.
   - A cozy loveseat covered with an Albanian flag-patterned throw, positioned in front of a simple TV showing an animated soccer match.
   - A bookshelf overflowing with soccer memorabilia, history books, and a few conspiracy theory pamphlets peeking out, emphasizing her passion and humor.

2. **Cultural Influence**:
   - A record player spinning a tallava music vinyl, underlining her musical preferences.
   - Picturesquely skewed paintings on the walls: a watercolor of the Albanian Alps and a proud eagle, symbolic of "The Land of Eagles."
   - A stack of homemade byrek on a small kitchen counter visible in the background, hinting at her love for sharing traditional foods.

3. **Humorous & Personal Touches**:
   - An oversized fake mustache placed humorously on a globe in the corner, an inside joke about her penchant for geographical debates.
   - An inflatable goat toy next to the window, a nod to her running gag about goats and geopolitics, playfully peeking outside.

4. **Atmosphere & Lighting**:
   - Warm and inviting lighting that mimics the neutral ambiance of an indoor space, suitable for focus adjustments using hue shifts.
   - Scattered colorful cushions on the floor, fostering a laid-back environment for casual soccer discussions or impromptu dance-offs.

The setting captures Albania's spirited, humorous, and culturally rich lifestyle while maintaining a relaxed webcam-style compositional focus, creating an animated and characterful backdrop free of text or overt realism.
