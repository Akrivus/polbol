Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for Kyrgyzstan's space in the show "polbots." The scene is a panoramic view inside his cozy living room, captured as if from a webcam. The room should reflect Kyrgyzstan's outdoorsy charm and deep cultural roots. 

The central piece is a low wooden table cluttered with cups of "kumyz" (fermented mare's milk) and some scattered traditional Kyrgyz board games. In the background, a colorful woolen shyrdak (traditional felt rug) drapes over a large couch, dotted with quirky yurt-shaped cushions.

To the right, a rustic shelf holds a collection of tiny yurts and a model of a horseback rider, nodding to his passion for "at chabysh." A potted plant resembling the wild junipers of Kyrgyzstan adds a touch of homey greenery, despite his country's famously rugged terrain.

On the left, a wide window offers a painted cartoon view of iconic, snowy mountains—prideful peaks that wink at his competitive humor. Below the window, a modest wooden desk houses an analog clock with simplistic numbers and a small chess set for quiet reflection on history and strategy.

In one corner, there's a tack board plastered with doodles of Issyk-Kul Lake and humorous failed attempts at kumyz branding, highlighting his endearing ambition to go global with Kyrgyz health trends. Small horseshoe magnets stick to a mini fridge, a playful tribute to his love of buzkashi, although no text is present.

Ensure lighting is soft and neutral, with flat shapes and simple lines to evoke a cartoonish feel. This quirky and culturally rich space is clearly Kyrgyzstan's realm, full of personality and warmth, just like him—without any inhabitants or characters shown in the room.
