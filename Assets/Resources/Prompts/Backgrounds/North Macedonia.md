Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper that captures the personal space of North Macedonia, the Countryball character from the show "polbots." Imagine a cozy living room that reflects her quirky personality and cultural influences.

The room should feature a colorful rug with patterns reminiscent of traditional Macedonian textiles, drawing the eye with its bold designs and vivid hues. To one side, a display of small potted peppers sits on a sunny windowsill, hinting at North Macedonia's love for gardening and her grandmother's ajvar recipe.

In the background, a bookshelf teems with documentaries and history books—a nod to her "world domination" Netflix binges. Interspersed are small, strategically placed statues mimicking Skopje’s unique architectural flair, each piece contrasting yet harmonizing with the next, echoing her appreciation for her city's evolving landscape.

A guitar hung on the wall indicates her fondness for traditional music and the lively energy of the oro dance, while a decorative map of the Balkans subtly illustrates her interest in diplomacy and historical connections.

On a small coffee table sits a delicate tea set, interrupted by a haphazard pile of note cards where phrase corrections might be scribbled—a playful touch to her identity struggles and tendency to over-apologize. The walls, while mostly neutral, feature an abstract mural of hands gesturing dramatically, capturing her comical penchant for exaggerated movement during conversation.

This space, cartoonish in style with flat shapes and simple details, brims with hints of North Macedonia’s multifaceted character, captured as if we’re peeking through a webcam at her endearing everyday environment.
