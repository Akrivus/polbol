**DALL-E Prompt:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character McDonald's from the show **polbots**. The scene should resemble a webcam view of McDonald's personal living space, reflecting his relentless salesman personality and American cultural influences. 

The room should feature the following details:
- A cluttered desk covered with fast food wrappers, promotional fliers for new menu items, and a bright calculator displaying prices.
- A bright red couch with cheerful cushions featuring smiling fries and burgers designs.
- A shelf filled with quirky items like a miniature statue of the Golden Arches, a “World’s Best Fast Food” trophy, and a collection of empty soda cans adorned with various international flags.
- Posters on the walls showcasing fictional fast-food promotions and cartoon mascots in comical poses.
- A window with a view showing a distant skyline filled with green neon signs and golden arches.
- Rugs and decorations in distinct yellow and red colors, creating a vibrant, lively atmosphere.
- Small details like a calendar reminding of "National Fast Food Day," a TV remote shaped like a McNugget, and a pile of unused menus to the side.

Ensure the scene is lively but unoccupied, with the lighting neutral, emphasizing the playful and slightly absurd personality of McDonald's. No text should appear, except for simple numeric signs such as '66' on a wall or a doorframe. The perspective should be natural like a webcam shot, capturing the essence of McDonald's as a humorous embodiment of capitalism and cultural imperialism.
