Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character in a show called **polbots**, specifically for Belarus, a Countryball character. Picture a cozy and slightly cluttered living room, beaming with Belarusian personality. The room is infused with a warm, earthy palette—soft greens, rich browns, and gentle lavenders reflecting the character's love for nature and tradition.

In one corner, there's a small, rustic banya-style wood stove, emanating virtual steam, hinting at his love for banya and serving as the room's quirky centerpiece. Surrounding the stove are simple wooden benches with neatly folded towels on them, adding a touch of authenticity to the scene.

On a round, simple table, there is a steaming mug of black tea and a few scattered, cartoonishly large chocolates with the characteristic red wrappers, nodding to his sweet tooth for Kommunarka chocolate. Nearby, an oversized teapot with traditional Belarusian patterns rests, surrounded by a couple of tea stains indicating heavy use.

Lush indoor plants occupy the rest of the room, some thriving and towering impressively, while others are mildly wilting, illustrative of Belarus's nonchalant gardening style. Straw weaving crafts hang whimsically around the window frames, as well as some scattered straw on the floor, bringing a sense of ongoing creative projects.

A retro shelf unit holds an assortment of vinyl records from Pesniary, hinting at his musical preferences, and below it, an old radio, adding a nostalgic touch. Nearby, an oversized headphone set rests, ready for his folk music sessions.

In the background, a rustic wooden table is barely visible under a pile of papers and documents—maps and old political sketches overflowing, representing his intricate, verbose involvement in diplomatic matters. A pin-up note reads "Big Brother" in simple characters, nudging towards the running gag about his relationship with Russia.

The room's overall feel is homely and inviting, with patches of humorous disarray reflecting Belarus's complex history and cultured personality. The scene captures the distinct balance between tradition and modernity that defines him, offering a cozy, relatable window into Belarus's world in the polbots universe.
