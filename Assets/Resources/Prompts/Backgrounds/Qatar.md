Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background set in Qatar's personal majlis—an opulent, inviting space that reflects the character's personality and cultural influences from the show "polbots." This panoramic scene is viewed from a webcam perspective, capturing a cozy, colorful room.

The room features luxurious, plush majlis seating in rich, regal colors like maroon and gold, arranged in a U-shape along the walls on soft, patterned carpets. A table in the center is set with intricate Arabic coffee pots (dallah) and small cups, alongside a generous tray filled with a variety of dates—symbolizing Qatar's love for gahwa and tradition.

To the right, a sleek, modern falcon perch serves as a decorative nod to his passion for falconry, with a few falcon-related trinkets scattered on nearby shelves, such as feathers and small figurines. Electronic gadgets subtly blend into the décor—a smart speaker, tablet, and a small drone on a charging pad hint at his affinity for tech (and comedic frustrations with it).

Camels gallop across the background on a stylized television screen displaying a camel race, with a partially visible betting slip carelessly tossed next to a sofa cushion. To the left, a mini soccer ball and remote control suggest Qatar’s pastime of watching FIFA matches.

The walls are adorned with tasteful geometric patterns, evoking both modern design and cultural heritage. A small window peeks out to a desert landscape, with sand dunes gently rolling under a clear sky, while luxurious drapes frame it in a burnished gold, enhancing the room's opulence.

Small, humorous details hint at his satirical quirks—a tiny model of a mountain with an attached fan labeled "air-conditioned peak concept" sits on a side table, and conference rosettes hang humorously from hooks, signifying his penchant for hosting events.

The lighting is warm and inviting, yet neutral, providing a lived-in feel without casting harsh shadows. The scene is inviting and whimsical, with a clear focus on Qatar’s personality and lifestyle influences within the "polbots" show.
