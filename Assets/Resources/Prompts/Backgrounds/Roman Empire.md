Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Roman Empire, known as "Rome," from the show polbots. Imagine you're viewing his living room via webcam, capturing his unique blend of ancient grandeur and humorous modern-day quirks. 

The setting is an elegantly cluttered Roman-themed living room, filled with objects that reflect Rome's whimsical nature:

- A vintage Roman toga draped over a modern sofa, with elaborate decorative patterns.
- Antique busts of Julius Caesar and other Roman figures perched on shelves, positioned to appear as an attentive audience.
- An old wooden coffee table covered with scrolls and parchments, alongside a modern laptop glowing with an epic drama paused on screen.
- Miniature pasta and wine setup, resembling a battlefield, arranged for a comedic reenactment of historical Roman battles.
- A stack of empty pizza boxes haphazardly discarded in a corner, with a wine bottle leaning against them.
- Curtains styled like Roman togas draping over large windows, letting in light that highlights the room's character.
- A gladiator helmet resting whimsically on a Wi-Fi router, symbolizing Rome's confusion with modern technology.
- A large tapestry on the wall depicting the Colosseum, framed by modern art that humorously juxtaposes ancient Roman aesthetics with contemporary flair.
- A small chariot replica positioned beside the television, humorously clashing with a remote control and gaming console.

Ensure the cartoon-style is reminiscent of MS Paint, with simple shapes and details that tell Rome's story through the room's layout and contents. The scene should ooze personality, humor, and a nostalgic yet comedic view of Rome's past grandeur blending with his attempts to embrace the present day, all in a cozy, personal living space.
