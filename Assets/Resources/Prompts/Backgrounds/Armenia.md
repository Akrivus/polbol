Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character in a show called **polbots**. The background is designed for Armenia, a Countryball character known for her love of jazz, duduk music, and Armenian culture. Imagine the view from a webcam in her cozy living room or personal space—without people or characters visible in the scene. Think of Armenia as a person and reflect their habits and personality through environmental details.

The room should exude warmth and comfort with soft, inviting undertones. The design should include:

- A plush, hand-woven carpet displaying intricate Armenian patterns, indicating her love for embroidery and carpet weaving.
- A small ornate table with a collection of dried fruits, prominently featuring apricots, and a vase filled with fragrant herbs.
- Jazz and duduk music vinyl records resting against a classic wooden record player, alongside a shelf of books ranging from Armenian folktales to jazz history.
- A cozy armchair draped with a traditional Armenian rug, next to an open book with a dusty page marked by a dried flower.
- A tapestry or wall hanging depicting Mount Ararat, subtly alluding to national pride without direct symbolism.
- A large horizontal window with sheer curtains letting in soft, natural light, adorned with potted plants—one perhaps resembling a small apricot tree.
- A collection of Armenian dolls or figurines arranged on a ledge, hinting at traditional crafts.
- An unused, vintage brass telephone atop a small wooden desk cluttered with rolled-up embroidery patterns—a nod to her humorous frustration with modern technology.
- A small charcoal grill near a corner with utensils for barbecuing, showcasing her fondness for khorovats.

Allow neutral lighting to bathe the scene, with a sense of warmth subtly enhanced by hue shifting. Aim for simple and flat cartoon designs, capturing a lived-in yet inviting space, reflecting Armenia’s wit, cultural richness, and nuanced humor as a character.
