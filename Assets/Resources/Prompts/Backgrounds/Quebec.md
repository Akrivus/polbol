Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character in a show called "polbots," featuring the personal space of Québec, the Countryball character. Imagine viewing her cozy living room via a webcam, capturing the essence of her spirited, art-loving, and culturally rich personality.

The room exudes a warm, inviting atmosphere, filled with quirky and vibrant details. The walls are adorned with colorful abstract art paintings and iconic prints of Céline Dion and Leonard Cohen, denoting her love for both. An easel in the corner hints at her artistic endeavors.

A comfy armchair sits next to a small side table with a mug of steaming café au lait. Nearby, a television is paused on a hockey match, with a stack of hockey pucks and a small flag featuring a maple leaf (crossed out) and the fleur-de-lis beside it humorously asserting her favorite Canadian icon.

The shelves are cluttered with books on Québécois history, a guide to perfecting poutine recipes, and stacked vinyl records. A small karaoke machine with a microphone on standby reflects her penchant for impromptu singing sessions. Green and gold leaves line the windowsill, reminiscent of a fall Quebec landscape.

Playful elements highlight her humorous traits—a cartoonishly long and exaggerated "Declaration of Independence" scroll partially unrolled across the floor. A globe sits on the desk, with Quebec labeled far larger than usual, showcasing her independent spirit.

The lighting is gentle and neutral, casting an indoor glow that sets a comfortable, lived-in vibe. The scene captures the essence of her contrasting yet harmonious dual nature, blending her Francophone heritage with her love of all things Canadian. This personal space is bustling with character, humor, and cultural pride, all seen through the lens of a webcam shot, with a cartoonishly simple and colorful style.
