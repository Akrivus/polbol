**DALL-E Prompt:**

Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the personal space of a character named Croatia from a show called "polbots." This is a webcam-style view into Croatia's living room, reflecting her personality, habits, and cultural influences. The perspective should be a natural, straight-on view, like what you'd see in a webcam shot, capturing the room's width without an overhead or floorplan view.

The room is filled with elements that tell Croatia's story, using simple shapes and flat colors akin to MS Paint. The design should be humorous in a light-hearted way, without any human characters present.

**Room Description:**
- The background features a cozy living room with bright Mediterranean colors like turquoise and terracotta.
- A beach-themed wall art on one wall, depicting Hvar with a cartoonish sunset over the Adriatic Sea.
- A bookshelf holding books on Croatian architecture and design, with a small football trophy proudly displayed.
- A small table near a window with a rakija bottle and a couple of glasses.
- A plush sofa with a Croatian football team blanket draped over it, exuding a sports fan's enthusiasm.
- A decorative lamp shaped like a Roman pillar, nodding to Croatiaâ€™s historical roots.
- A few potted plants, including a lavender plant, adding a touch of Mediterranean calmness.
- Quirky knick-knacks on shelves, like a mini model of the Dubrovnik city walls and a small EU flag, reflecting her humor about her EU recognition.
- The far wall has a calendar, with the month of July highlighted, symbolizing her love for summer beach trips.

Ensure the scene is well-lit with neutral indoor lighting to maintain clarity, allowing for hue shifting to adjust the mood if necessary. The background should be panoramic and full-width, conveying a sense of personal space and energy that matches Croatia's vibrant personality, infused with her quirks and humor.
