Create a vibrant, cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for a character space in the show **polbots**, focusing on the Countryball character, Maldives (she/her). Visualize her habitat with a serene, beach-vibe living room. Picture a cozy apartment with gentle, ocean-inspired decor that highlights her laid-back and tropical essence.

The scene shows a hammock stretched diagonally across the room, lightly swaying above the wooden floor. Surrounding the hammock are small piles of colorful sea shells and translucent sea-glass art projects, reflecting her love for crafting with marine treasures.

The walls are adorned with large canvases depicting abstract depictions of ocean waves and sunlit coral gardens. Gentle blue and sandy yellow hues dominate the scene, mirroring the colors of a sunlit beach with ocean-inspired elements like a big round window resembling a ship’s porthole, flooding soft natural light into the room.

On one side of the room, a small kitchenette is visible, with a collection of spices and ingredients for traditional dishes. The counter has a neatly arranged row of coconuts and a small blender, indicating her penchant for fresh coconut drinks.

In another corner, a wooden record player softly spins a vinyl record, hinting at her love for Maldivian boduberu music. Delicate lanterns made from woven materials hang from the ceiling, casting a warm, inviting glow over the space, near a small sand-filled glass jar serving as a quirky paperweight on a shelf full of travel photos – mostly scenic selfies labeled “#IslandLife” funds exaggerated poses on exotic beaches.

To emphasize her environmental zeal, the room features indoor plants in quirky, upcycled containers, and a noticed shelf labeled "Coconut Recognized Happiness," lined with eco-friendly water canteens and smoothies.

Adding a humorous touch, align flip-flops of varying colors rest cheekily by the door, in a pattern that humorously hints at her playful nature. A cheeky sign is visually suggested by a depiction of footprints indicating "High Tide Excuse Zone."

The room encapsulates a lighthearted atmosphere where the character’s laid-back spirit, passion for the environment, and cultural pride are subtly interwoven into every detail in a cartoonish, enchanting way.
