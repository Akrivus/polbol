**Prompt:** Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background depicting the personal space of the Countryball character, California, from the show **polbots**. The scene should be a panoramic, webcam-style view of a laid-back, eclectic room reflecting California's vibrant personality and lifestyle. The room should have a balanced blend of mid-century modern decor and quirky elements symbolizing Silicon Valley and Venice Beach.

Picture a sunlit space with an open sliding door leading to a beach view, surfboards leaning against the wall, and solar panels visible outside. The interior is a mix of tech gadgets on minimalist tables, such as a VR headset and a laptop with a floral design cover. There's a yoga mat spread out randomly, and a shelf holding vegan cookbooks, sustainable product samples, and houseplants in quirky pots. 

The furniture is a mix of comfy beach chairs and sleek, modern pieces. A vibrant beach towel hangs over a chair, and there are recycled material throw pillows scattered on a couch. The coffee table holds the remnants of a kale smoothie in an empty bamboo cup alongside reusable straws and an open book about 1960s counterculture. Wall art includes framed abstract waves and tech event posters, contributing to her dual persona. 

Ensure the scene features cartoon-style elements with flat shapes and simple details, matching the whimsical, satirical nature of her character. Keep the perspective natural and ensure the scene appears lived-in, but with no characters present. Maximize the use of colors and hue shifts to capture California's lively and free-spirited ambiance, while maintaining a humorous touch through select details like a mini wind turbine sculpture on the desk.
