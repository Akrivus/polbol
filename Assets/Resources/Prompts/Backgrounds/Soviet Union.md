Create a cartoon-style digital wallpaper background for the character Soviet Union (he/him) from the show "polbots." Picture a cozy, spectral living space like a haunting apartment or office. This space should visually reflect his ghostly persona and his rich, nostalgic personality as described:

1. **Overall Ambiance:**
   - A dimly lit room with a spectral, ethereal glow, as if lit by ghostly candles.
   
2. **Furniture & Layout:**
   - A cozy, oversized armchair, slightly worn, draped with a faded, ghostly red throw (a nod to the communist flag).
   - A classic wooden desk cluttered with spectral paperwork, old maps, and blueprints of hypothetical five-year plans.
   - A small, spectral bookshelf filled with vintage novels and history texts.
   - Ghostly balalaika leaning against the chair.
   
3. **Decorations & Clutter:**
   - A spectral bottle of vodka sits on a side table, slightly floating.
   - A framed photograph of the first Sputnik satellite hangs slightly crooked on the wall.
   - A corner filled with transparent Tetris blocks as a whimsical take on his love for order and planning.
   - A small table with an ethereal bowl of borscht, exuding faint vapor.
   - A large poster depicting the "glorious days" of the USSR, like cosmonauts or Red Square parades, softly pulsating as if alive.
   
4. **Humorous and Quirky Details:**
   - A never-ending queue of ghostly figures waiting near the door, symbolizing his nostalgia for communal life.
   - A spectral typewriter with paper perpetually stuck, representing his obsession with bureaucracy.
   - A transparent Soviet-style phone on the desk, slightly off its cradle.
   
5. **Cultural Influences:**
   - Spectral samovar subtly billowing ghostly steam, hinting at his affinity for traditional communal tea times.
   - A small, icy window showing faint outlines of an endless Siberian landscape.

The scene should be panoramic, capturing the charming clutter and nostalgia through a whimsical, cartoon-style lens, free of overt text and characters, hinting subtly at Soviet Union's life, humor, and quirks in "polbots."
