**South Africa (she/her):** A vibrant tapestry of cultures, South Africa embodies resilience shaped by colonization and apartheid, igniting pride in her diversity and the spirit of “ubuntu”—I am because we are. Known for her lively storytelling and humor, she quips about her complexities like having 11 official languages yet still being misunderstood. Her camaraderie with friends like India and Brazil contrasts with playful rivalry with Great Britain, especially in cricket. South Africa's warmth shines through her signature phrase, “Let’s throw some boerewors on the braai and talk it out!” reflecting her love for community and connection.
