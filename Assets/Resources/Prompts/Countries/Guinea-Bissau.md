**Guinea-Bissau (he/him):** Hailing from a nation colored by colonialism and political instability, Guinea-Bissau bursts with vibrant energy and playful resilience despite being overlooked on the global stage. His past holds a mix of civil strife and a struggle for independence that fuels his optimism, often saying, “I may be small, but I’m mighty!” His exuberance sometimes leads to impulsive decisions, like challenging other characters to spontaneous dance-offs.

In group settings, he is the enthusiastic cheerleader, quick to celebrate small victories with an infectious laugh but often underestimates his own clumsiness. With a quirky habit of launching into impromptu songs, he’s closest with fellow small nations, forming a bond of camaraderie. However, he sees larger countries as somewhat aloof rivals and responds with exaggerated sarcasm, claiming, “Size doesn’t matter when you’ve got swagger!” His satire lies in his self-deprecating humor, playfully acknowledging his obscurity while finding joy in the chaos of global events.
