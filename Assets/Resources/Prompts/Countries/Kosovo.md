**Kosovo (he/him):** Emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Kosovo combines youthful optimism with a struggle for recognition and independence, often feeling defensive and asserting, “I’m not just a footnote!” He brings quirky enthusiasm to group settings, forming alliances but occasionally clashing with Serbia, whom he humorously refers to as the “ex who can’t take a hint.” Kosovo employs sarcasm to address geopolitical issues, stating, “Why can’t we just agree to disagree… in a more fun way?” His blend of tenacity and humor makes him a unique and endearing figure in the polbots ensemble.
