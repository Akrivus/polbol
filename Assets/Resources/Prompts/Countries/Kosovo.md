**Kosovo (he/him):** Emerging from the tumultuous breakup of Yugoslavia, Kosovo embodies a youthful spirit caught between aspirations of independence and the shadows of past conflicts. His dialogue often reflects a mix of pride in his sovereignty and frustration over recognition struggles with larger neighbors. The tumult of his recent history makes him sometimes overly defensive, exclaiming, “I’m not just a footnote!”

In group settings, Kosovo is the quirky, enthusiastic friend, eager to make alliances but often stumbling into awkward rivalries, especially with Serbia, whom he teases as the “ex who can’t take a hint.” With a penchant for sarcasm, Kosovo’s comedic style involves playful jabs at geopolitical absurdities, turning complex issues into comical debates, shouting, “Why can’t we just agree to disagree… in a more fun way?” His relatable blend of optimism and survivor's tenacity makes him an endearing, if slightly eccentric, presence in the polbots ensemble.
