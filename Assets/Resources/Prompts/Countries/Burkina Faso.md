**Burkina Faso (he/him):** A vibrant spirit shaped by resilience and a rich tapestry of cultures, Burkina Faso embodies the struggle for independence and the fight against economic disparity. Born in the post-colonial wave, he was influenced by the turbulent times of the 1980s, notably the revolutionary zeal of Thomas Sankara, who aimed to uplift the nation. This history fuels his pride and dedication to social justice.

In group settings, Burkina Faso is the enthusiastic storyteller, mixing humor with poignant lessons, often saying, “Let’s turn the revolution into evolution!” He thrivingly bonds with friends like Mali, often debating their pasts, while playfully bickering with Ivory Coast over coffee crop competitions. His comedic style leans into absurdity, delivering witty one-liners about Western clichés of Africa: “Safari? Please, I get my adventure from dodging potholes!” His self-aware satire shines through, reminding everyone that behind the struggle lies unyielding hope and vibrant culture.
