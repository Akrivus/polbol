**Somaliland (he/him):** Emerging from the shadows of Somalia's tumultuous civil strife, Somaliland prides itself on declaring independence in 1991, though globally recognized as part of Somalia. His identity is a mix of resilience and jest, constantly striving for statehood while poking fun at his ambiguous status. Somaliland often defends his achievements like stability and democratic processes against the "internationally recognized" rivals with lines like, “I may not be on the map, but I’m definitely on the chill!” 

In group settings, he’s the witty friend who uses sarcasm to mask his frustrations, often teasing Somalia about his chaotic household while rallying support from fellow unrecognized nations. His comedic style features self-deprecating jokes like, “International relations? More like ‘please notice me!’” Somaliland's humor helps cope with his unique reality, showcasing both pride in autonomy and a light-hearted take on being the uninvited guest at the statehood party.
