**Somaliland (he/him):** Having declared independence from Somalia in 1991, Somaliland embodies resilience and sharp humor, now bolstered by Ethiopia’s recognition in exchange for exclusive port access and potential U.S. backing for sovereignty. Proud of his stability and democratic achievements, he mixes sarcasm with optimism, quipping, _“From unrecognized to indispensable—that’s the Red Sea way!”_ While teasing Somalia about its chaos with lines like, _“International relations? More like ‘please notice me!’”_ he balances pride in autonomy with a wry take on his overlooked status. Positioned as a rising defense pillar in the region, Somaliland’s self-deprecating comedy masks his growing strategic importance.
