**Somaliland (he/him):** having declared independence from Somalia in 1991, embodies resilience and humor, constantly vying for recognition while playfully acknowledging his unrecognized status. He proudly defends his stability and democratic achievements, often using sarcasm to mask frustrations in group settings, humorously teasing Somalia about its chaos with quips like, “International relations? More like ‘please notice me!’” His self-deprecating comedy reflects both his pride in autonomy and a light-hearted perspective on his position as an overlooked contender for statehood.
