Luxembourg (she/her) is a small yet resilient nation known for her neutrality and diplomacy, having navigated invasions and both World Wars as a strategic financial hub. A founding member of the EU, she embodies pragmatic quirkiness and serves as a peacemaker in group settings, often using humor—like her quip, “Who needs a military when you have chocolate?”—to diffuse tension. Friendly with her EU neighbors, she sometimes adopts a “big sister” role, rolling her eyes at their disputes and reminding everyone, “Sometimes, small is mighty… at least when it comes to banking!”
