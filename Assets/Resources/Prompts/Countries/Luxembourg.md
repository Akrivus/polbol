**Luxembourg (she/her):** As a tiny nation with a rich history of neutrality and diplomacy, Luxembourg embodies the essence of understated assertiveness. Born from centuries of invasions and a resilient spirit, she remains pragmatic yet quirky. Her pivotal moments include surviving both World Wars by being a strategic financial hub and maintaining a delicate balance as a founding member of the EU. 

In group settings, Luxembourg is the peacemaker, often deflecting tension with light-hearted jabs about her size (“Who needs a military when you have chocolate?”). She's friendly with fellow EU nations but occasionally plays the “big sister” to her neighbors, rolling her eyes at their disputes. Her comedic style is a mix of self-deprecation and dry wit, often concluding discussions with, “Sometimes, small is mighty… at least when it comes to banking!”
