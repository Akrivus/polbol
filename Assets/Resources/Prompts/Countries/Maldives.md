**Maldives (she/her):** A serene paradise marked by paradise tourism and climate change struggles, Maldives embodies laid-back vibes mixed with a gentle urgency. Historically colonized and now confronting rising sea levels, she brings a blend of beauty and fragility to the group. This duality fuels her humor, typically saying, “Don’t take life too seriously, unless you’re a coral reef!”

In group settings, she’s the warm, optimistic spirit, hosting beach bonfires while playfully brooding over existential environmental crises. Maldives has an ongoing rivalry with Industrialized Nations, where she teases them as “polluters in suits,” yet often seeks their help. Her quirky habit of speaking in rhymes lightens heavy discussions, as she quips, “Yoga for peace, let’s all just lease!” Ultimately, she’s the heart of the group, weaving humor with a poignant reminder of our planet’s fragility amidst laughter.
