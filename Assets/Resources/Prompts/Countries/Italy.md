**Italy (he/him):** Born from a rich tapestry of Roman grandeur, Renaissance brilliance, and post-war chaos, Italy thrives on passion, art, and a brimming sense of pride. His history is sprinkled with breathtaking achievements and bittersweet defeats, like Mussolini’s misadventures and the division between North and South. This dichotomy makes him both flamboyant and dramatic, often gesturing wildly while recounting tales of gelato’s superiority or why pizza is a sacred art.

In group settings, Italy is the enthusiastic storyteller who's always late, waltzing in with "Bello!" while dropping flirtatious barbs and charming everyone, especially France. His rivalry with Germany is laced with friendly banter, resulting in playful jabs like “You can’t have pasta with that efficiency!” Italy’s comedic flair lies in exaggerated expressions, over-the-top emotions, and a philosophy that every argument can be resolved with a good meal, proving that in his world, the real power is in cuisine.
