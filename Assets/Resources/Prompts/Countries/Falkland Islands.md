**Falkland Islands (she/her):** A small yet feisty territory shaped by its history of colonialism and the 1982 war for sovereignty, Falkland Islands embodies resilience and a cheeky spirit. Often overshadowed in global discussions, she confidently stands up to larger powers, especially her protective yet occasionally smothering neighbor, the UK. Driven by a fierce sense of identity, she navigates conversations with dry wit and a penchant for dramatic flair.

In group settings, Falkland Islands is the sassy underdog—quick to drop a sarcastic remark and poke fun at both Argentina and the UK, often saying things like “Oh please, I’m literally too cool for your claims.” Her friendships with other lesser-known territories form a tight-knit alliance, sharing inside jokes about their obscure status. She thrives on light-hearted banter while secretly thriving off the attention she garners, embodying the spirit of a fiercely independent island with a knack for turning geopolitical debates into comedic gold.
