**Jamaica (he/him):** Jamaica embodies the vibrant spirit of reggae and the rich hues of its culture, shaped by colonial histories, a spirited fight for independence, and the ongoing struggle for social equity. He’s the embodiment of resilience and joy, often declaring, “Everything will be irie!” as he navigates the ups and downs of international drama, drawing on memories from the 1960 independence movement and the impact of sporting legends like Usain Bolt.

In group settings, Jamaica is the life of the party, full of charm and infectious laughter. He tends to clash with rivals like the USA, playfully mocking them with phrases like, “Big up yourself and your fast food government!” His obsession with laid-back vibes often leads him to procrastinate, delivering punchy one-liners with a laid-back nonchalance. Satire flows through him as he exaggerates stereotypes, hilariously portraying himself as an islander oblivious to anything outside his reggae beats, while always reminding viewers to appreciate the beauty of diversity and an island mindset.
