**Lebanon (she/her):** With a rich history marked by ancient civilizations, the Phoenician legacy, and the pains of civil wars, Lebanon embodies resilience and complexity. She is at once vibrant and chaotic, reflecting a tapestry of cultures and a love for food—a true host who can turn even a political debate into a feast. Despite struggles with economic turmoil and regional tensions, her humor is a shield, making light of difficult situations with quips like, “Why have one crisis when you can have a buffet of them?”

In group settings, Lebanon is the lively, outspoken friend who rallies others for spontaneous adventures (and often late-night debates over who’s the best at hummus). With frenemies like Syria and Israel, she pokes fun while secretly navigating their rivalries with finesse. Her signature catchphrase? “Can we just take a moment for the shawarma?”—a comedic nod to her love for comfort food amidst chaos, maintaining her charm and wit in every situation.
