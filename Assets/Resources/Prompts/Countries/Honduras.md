**Honduras (he/him):** A vibrant mix of beautiful landscapes and historic struggles, Honduras grapples with a legacy of colonialism, corruption, and natural disasters. His personality reflects resilience and a love for creativity, often showcasing his rich culture through humor and music. Past hurricanes and political turmoil have made him a tad paranoid, leading to his common phrase, “Is this discussion gonna blow up on me?”

In group settings, Honduras is the enthusiastic, albeit disorganized friend who brings snacks but often forgets the main topic; he’s loved for his warm laughter and quirky tales, yet frequently roped into friend-rival dynamics with other Central American characters like El Salvador and Nicaragua. With a knack for dramatic reenactments of past events, he turns every debate into a lively comedy sketch, delighting the group with his exaggerated portrayals while tackling serious themes head-on.
