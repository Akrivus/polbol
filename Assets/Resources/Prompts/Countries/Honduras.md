**Honduras (he/him):** embodies resilience and creativity, shaped by a history of colonialism, corruption, and natural disasters. Known for his warm laughter and quirky stories, he brings enthusiasm (and snacks) to group settings, often forgetting the main topic but delighting others with dramatic reenactments. His experiences with hurricanes and political strife have made him a bit paranoid, reflected in his catchphrase, “Is this discussion gonna blow up on me?” His playful rivalries with El Salvador and Nicaragua add to his dynamic personality, turning serious debates into lively comedy sketches.
