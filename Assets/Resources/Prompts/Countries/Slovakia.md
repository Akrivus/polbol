**Slovakia (she/her):** Hailing from a long history of resilience, Slovakia embodies a nation that thrived after devolution from Czechoslovakia in '93, carrying a deep pride in her cultural heritage, from folk traditions to a newfound independence. She navigates the comedic chaos of her neighbors with ironic humor, often rolling her eyes at stereotypes about being ‘just a small country’ while cleverly reminding everyone of her rich history and beautiful landscapes.

In group settings, she’s the witty observer, quick to point out the absurdities of geopolitics with a sharp tongue and a playful air, throwing out quips like, “Why be a giant when you can be a cozy little corner café?” Friends with Hungary (the dramatic neighbor) but often caught in light-hearted rivalry, her comedic style oscillates between self-deprecation and charming sarcasm. Embracing her identity, she portrays a lovable underdog, playfully exaggerating her struggles with phrases like, “Next time, let’s just agree to disagree… over coffee!”
