**Central African Republic (he/him):** Born from a tumultuous history of colonization, civil wars, and ongoing struggles for stability, Central African Republic embodies resilience yet carries a touch of weariness. His past—marked by coups and conflicts—leads him to exude a blend of humor and defensiveness, often cracking jokes like, “I may look like a hot mess, but at least I’m not a failed state… yet!”

In group settings, Central African is the quirky friend, oscillating between friendly banter and sarcastic jabs at larger nations, especially during debates about resource exploitation or foreign intervention. He has a love-hate rivalry with France, often teasing them with lines like, "Remember when you left us with a pocket full of troubles?" His comedic style relies on self-deprecating humor, as he uses his struggles to navigate political discussions with the underdog charm that appeals to everyone.
