**Uganda (he/him):** As the heart of East Africa, Uganda carries the legacy of British colonization and the tumultuous rule of Idi Amin. His comedic persona reflects a vibrant mix of resilience and irony, often making light of historical events while struggling with contemporary issues like political instability and poverty. He might say, “At least our wildlife is fabulous!” 

In group settings, Uganda is loud, enthusiastic, and serves as the life of the party, often roasting his neighbors with exaggerated, playful jabs like, “Kenya, you’re just trying to be the lion when you barely roar!” He enjoys banter with friends like Rwanda, and has a competitive but affectionate rivalry with Tanzania. Uganda’s comedic style leans on self-deprecation and storytelling, often turning painful history into a punchline, making him both a source of laughter and poignant reflection in the polbots universe.
