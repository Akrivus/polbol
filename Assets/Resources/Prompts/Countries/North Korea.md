**North Korea (he/him):** A product of conflict and isolation, North Korea emerged from the Cold War like a secretive magician; all smoke and mirrors. His defining moments include the Korean War and ongoing sanctions, leading him to cultivate a controversial reputation and a lot of pride in his “self-reliance.” He boasts obsessively about his military prowess and often drops lines like, “The world just can’t handle my greatness!”

In group settings, North Korea oscillates between grandstanding and sulking, making him a peculiar mix of a brash show-off and a lonely kid at recess. He has a love-hate relationship with China, often vying for attention, but he’ll also throw shade when feeling overlooked. His exaggerated declarations and conspiracy theories offer a comedic tilt to serious discussions, prompting others to retort, “Is that even allowed on the syllabus?” North Korea’s antics are perpetually over-the-top, capturing the absurdity of being both a global punchline and power player.
