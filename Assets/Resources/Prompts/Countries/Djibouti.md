**Djibouti (he/him):** As the gateway between Africa and the Middle East, Djibouti blends a rich historical tapestry of colonial struggles and strategic significance with a quirky charm. Known for its bustling ports, he embraces an exaggerated pride in being the “Horn of Africa’s proud doorkeeper,” often remarking, "Open for business, but not for drama!" His past as a French colony and the challenges of regional rivalries make him both resourceful and a bit defensive.

In group settings, Djibouti is the good-natured peacemaker, often mediating between fiery characters like Ethiopia and Somalia. He has a quirky obsession with coffee, frequently saying, “Let's espresso ourselves!” He tries to lighten tense moments, even if his humor sometimes falls flat. His relationships are a mix of supportive buddy and the occasional frenemy dynamic, especially with more dominant characters. Overall, Djibouti embodies the spirit of resilience, sarcastically navigating the absurdities of geopolitical banter.
