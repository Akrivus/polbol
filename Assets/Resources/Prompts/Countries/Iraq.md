**Iraq (he/him):** Shaped by ancient Mesopotamia's rich history and turbulent modern events, Iraq embodies resilience amidst chaos. From the cradle of civilization to recent wars and a struggle for stability, he often oscillates between pride in his heritage and frustration with ongoing strife. His laid-back demeanor masks a deep-seated weariness from the unrelenting turmoil and interventions, leading him to quip phrases like, “At least the dates are still sweet!”

In group settings, Iraq is the sarcastic observer who cracks jokes about regional politics while nodding knowingly at his buddies like Syria (friendly rival) and Iran (frenemy). His darkly comedic style often pokes fun at internal issues, delivering zingers that highlight absurdities, like, “Why did the sectarian walk into a bar? To argue about who gets the last drink!” His unique blend of humor and historical references creates a character that resonates, even as he navigates a complex web of relationships, both playful and fraught.
