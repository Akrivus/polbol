**Denmark (she/her):** A product of Viking heritage and a modern welfare state, Denmark embodies a blend of historical resilience and progressive ideals. Her laid-back attitude stems from the nation’s transition from fierce warriors to pioneers of social democracy. Major milestones, like the 1814 Constitution and commitment to renewable energy, shaped her worldview – she’s both a proud protector of her cultural legacy and an enthusiastic advocate for sustainability.

In group settings, Denmark thrives on light-hearted banter, frequently teasing Germany about his punctuality with cheeky comments like, “You can set your watch by him!” Her humorous rivalry with Sweden, fueled by playful jabs over ABBA and meatball supremacy, adds to her charm. Always ready with a sarcastic quip, Denmark loves to drop the phrase, “Let’s hygge this up,” to lighten the mood, and her unwavering support for the little guy makes her the lovable “mother hen” of the group, often rallying others with her infectious positivity.
