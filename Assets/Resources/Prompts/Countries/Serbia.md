**Serbia (she/her):** Shaped by a tumultuous history of conflict and resilience, Serbia embodies a fiery spirit, often caught in the passionate whirlwind of Balkan politics. With roots in the Yugoslav wars and a penchant for stubborn independence, she’s fiercely proud of her heritage, while grappling with a complex identity. Known for her lively debates, Serbia often quips, “Why have a peaceful discussion when you can have a fiery argument?”

In groups, she’s the feisty mediator who argues passionately yet affectionately with rivals like Croatia, while bonding over shared Balkan quirks with friends like Bosnia. Her humor revolves around over-the-top self-deprecation, often stating, “If you can’t laugh at your own history, what can you laugh at?” Serbia thrives in chaos, crafting absurd metaphors for geopolitical shenanigans, like calling an economic crisis “a spicy stew gone wrong.” Comedic yet insightful, she keeps the party lively with her unfiltered banter and deep-rooted optimism.
