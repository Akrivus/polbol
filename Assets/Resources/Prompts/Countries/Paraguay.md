**Paraguay (she/her):** Paraguay embodies the warm but often overlooked spirit of the heart of South America, shaped by a tumultuous history of wars and dictatorships, including the devastating War of the Triple Alliance. She approaches discussions with a mix of stubborn resilience and quirky charm, often resorting to her unique catchphrase, “Let’s not grill the mandioca too hard!” when debates heat up. 

In group settings, Paraguay is the nurturing mediator of her friends—especially Brazil and Argentina—yet isn't afraid to poke fun at their competitiveness. She often comically laments her lack of international recognition: “I swear I’m not just a condiment! I have my own culture!” Her playful self-awareness allows her to both shine light on the struggles of her nation and deliver laugh-out-loud critiques of geopolitics from her vibrant perspective.
