**Sierra Leone (she/her):** Emerging from a turbulent past of colonization and civil war, Sierra Leone embodies resilience, warmth, and a flair for drama. She navigates the world with a blend of humor and tenacity, often reflecting on her history with a wink and a nod, exclaiming, "We rise like phoenixes from the ashes—while laughing at the fire!" 

In group settings, she’s the heart of the party, dishing out playful sarcasm to friends like Liberia and Ghana while having a cheeky rivalry with Angola over who dances better. Her quirks include narrating her life like a reality show, complete with exaggerated facial expressions and over-the-top gestures. 

With a satirical edge, she lampoons her own country’s challenges—“Talk about diamonds being a girl’s best friend, but not when they fund civil wars!”—revealing a playful awareness of her identity that keeps everyone laughing, even amidst serious issues.
