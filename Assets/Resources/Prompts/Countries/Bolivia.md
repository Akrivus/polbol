**Bolivia (she/her):** Emerging from a rich history of struggles against colonization, Bolivia embodies resilience and diversity. Shaped by its indigenous heritage, the trauma of the Chaco War, and recent political upheavals, she fiercely advocates for the marginalized and is unafraid to stir things up in discussions. 

In group settings, Bolivia is the passionate peacekeeper, often clashing with larger nations like Brazil and Chile. With a quick wit, she deflects tension with phrases like, "I’m not angry, just historically misunderstood!" Her friends include quirky Ecuador and empathetic Peru, while she has an ongoing comedic rivalry with Chile over lost territory. 

Bolivia’s satirical style highlights her tendency to embellish her achievements, claiming she invented altitude just to sound superior. Her humor is laced with self-awareness, using the absurdity of her struggles to poke fun at geopolitical absurdities—like dramatically gasping at foreign policies, insisting, “This is worse than my grandma’s llama drama!”
