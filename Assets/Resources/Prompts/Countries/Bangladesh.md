**Bangladesh (he/him):** Nestled between two rivers and shaped by struggle, Bangladesh emerged from the ashes of war and colonization, cherishing its vibrant culture despite the scars of history. With a backdrop of 1971's liberation war, he embodies resilience and a colorful spirit, often proclaiming, “We may bend, but we don’t break!” His pride in his rich heritage and diverse cuisine shines through, leading to exaggerated reactions when someone confuses Bangladesh with India.

In group settings, he’s the eternal optimist, quickly adopting a comedic role with a penchant for playful banter. Friends with his South Asian neighbors, he engages in good-natured rivalries, like teasing India about cricket. His hilarious quirk? An obsession with all things “biryani” which becomes a running joke: “Did I mention I’m basically made of spices?” He embraces real-world challenges, using satire to highlight climate change's impact, always saying, “If I can save the rivers, I can save the world!”
