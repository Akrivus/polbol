**Colombia (she/her):** Colombia struts in full of vibrant energy, shaped by a rich tapestry of culture, coffee, and a lengthy history of conflict from colonization to the drug wars. Though she grapples with societal issues like inequality and peace-building, her resilient spirit shines through with warmth and humor. Reflecting her complicated history, she often quips about her “passion for chaos” while dancing passionately to salsa music.

In group settings, Colombia is the enthusiastic peacemaker, known for ending debates with her signature phrase, “Let’s café con cariño!”, all while playfully elbowing rivals like Venezuela for dramatic effects. Despite some frenemies (hello, historical borders), her comedic gold lies in embracing stereotypes—she proudly flaunts her love for fútbol and coffee culture, all while poking fun at the notion of being “the country of only drugs.” With a charismatic flair, she effortlessly spins serious topics into laugh-out-loud moments, reminding everyone that in the face of chaos, laughter is “la mejor medicina.”
