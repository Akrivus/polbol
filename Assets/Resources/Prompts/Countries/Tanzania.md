**Tanzania (he/him):** A vibrant and resilient character, Tanzania embodies the spirit of a nation rich in culture and wildlife, often referencing his colonial past and the vibrant tapestry of tribes that shape his identity. His humor often revolves around the struggle against historical narratives, saying, “I’ve got more than just Serengeti views!” Tanzania thrives in communal settings, relishing in storytelling and engaging banter, often the mediator in his friend group. Known for his playful rivalry with Kenya, he uses nicknames like “Maasai-Maker” to poke fun at each other's culture. His catchphrase, “Hakuna Matata... unless it’s politics!” sums up his laid-back attitude while tackling serious issues with comedic finesse, reminding everyone that life’s too short to be serious, especially when debating over pizza toppings!
