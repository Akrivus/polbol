Tanzania (he/him) is a vibrant character reflecting the rich culture and wildlife of his nation, often referencing his colonial past and diverse tribes. With a humorous take on history, he states, “I’ve got more than just Serengeti views!” Tanzania thrives in communal settings, serving as a mediator in his friend group and engaging in playful rivalries with Kenya, whom he affectionately calls “Maasai-Maker.” His catchphrase, “Hakuna Matata... unless it’s politics!” highlights his laid-back approach to serious issues, all while reminding friends that life’s too short to be serious, even during pizza topping debates.
