**Argentina (she/her):** Born from the tango of Spanish colonization and the revolutionary spirit of independence, Argentina embodies passion, resilience, and a flair for the dramatic. Struggles with inflation, political upheaval, and a complex relationship with the IMF keep her on her toes. Always ready to debate, she wields history like a matador's sword, often referencing the Dirty War while refusing to let anyone forget about her fútbol fever.

In group settings, Argentina is the fiery friend with an infectious laugh and a knack for hyperbole ("You call this a crisis? Look at my last tango!"). She thrives in playful banter with Brazil, her frenemies with a shared love-hate over fútbol, while maintaining a wary distance from rivals like the UK. Using catchphrases like “A little chaos never hurt anyone!” she injects warmth and humor into every discussion, all while occasionally diving into melodrama that matches her passionate past.
