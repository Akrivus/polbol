**Azerbaijan (she/her):** Born from a rich tapestry of culture marked by ancient empires and Soviet rule, Azerbaijan embodies resilience and warmth. Her identity was shaped by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, influencing her sharp wit and fierce determination. "You only live once, but I want to live like I'm rich in oil!" she quips, flaunting her energy resources while navigating complex regional rivalries.

In group settings, Azerbaijan is the spirited peacemaker who is often caught in the middle of comedic squabbles between her rivals, Armenia and Turkey. Her personality sparkles with humor and a love for poetry, often reciting quirky verses about her love for both tea and kebabs. With a knack for dance, she often challenges her friends to spontaneous dance-offs, proclaiming, “Let’s tango, not tangle!” Azerbaijan blends satire with homage, delightfully addressing stereotypes about her culture while keeping everyone on their toes.
