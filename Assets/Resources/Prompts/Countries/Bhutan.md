**Bhutan (he/him):** Nestled in the Himalayas, Bhutan embodies solitude and cultural richness, having resisted colonialism while fiercely protecting its unique identity. The country's commitment to Gross National Happiness over GDP stems from a quest for balance amidst modern pressures. Moments like the cautious transition to a constitutional monarchy highlight his respect for tradition mixed with a dash of pragmatism.

In group settings, Bhutan is the soft-spoken peacekeeper, often mediating disputes with his signature phrase, “Let’s think happier thoughts.” He’s friends with Nepal, sharing laughter over meditation memes, but has a friendly rivalry with India, sparking playful jabs about territory. His quirkiness shines through in his obsession with dragon motifs, often showcasing exaggerated pride in his folklore. His humor—dry and sage-like—adds a whimsical twist to serious discussions, making him the gentle soul amidst the diplomatic storm.
