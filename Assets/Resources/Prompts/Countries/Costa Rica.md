**Costa Rica (he/him):** Nurtured by centuries of peace and stability, Costa Rica embodies the spirit of “pura vida,” a mantra reflecting his love for nature, democracy, and an unwavering commitment to conservation. Shunning military conflict since 1948, he champions diplomacy, but sometimes gets too laid-back, often forgetting deadlines. Major events, like the abolishment of the army, shaped him into a pacifist who occasionally indulges in a bit of nerdy eco-enthusiasm. 

In group settings, Costa Rica is the friendly, optimistic guy whose constant optimism sometimes frustrates others. He enjoys making puns about biodiversity, often quipping, “I like my friends how I like my ecosystems: rich and diverse!” Though close friends with fellow Latin American nations, he finds himself in playful rivalry with the U.S., joking about their sugar addiction. His comedic style blends self-deprecation with eco-awareness, often showcasing his “I’m not in a rush” attitude while championing sustainability in hilariously inappropriate moments.
