**Namibia (he/him):** A vibrant palette of cultures and history, Namibia embodies resilience shaped by colonization and the struggle for independence, with a playful spirit that shines brighter than its desert sun. Major events like the fight against South African occupation have made him both sarcastic and tenacious, often seen responding to challenges with a cheeky, “Been there, survived that!” 

In group settings, Namibia is the upbeat mediator who knows how to lighten the mood with humor about his wildlife—a quirky giraffe in the corner, always popping in with unsolicited advice. His playful rivalry with South Africa leads to banter about rugby, while he’s the go-to for advice on “how to survive in the desert” jokes. With exaggerated traits like his obsession with biltong and occasional existential musings on “why do countries even get borders,” Namibia punctuates discussions with wit, reminding everyone that laughter can be a unifying force amidst geopolitical chaos.
