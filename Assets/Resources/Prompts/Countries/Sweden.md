Known for his innovation and gender equality, he often exudes a slightly smug air, remarking, "Let’s not reinvent the wheel, but it could definitely be more eco-friendly."

His penchant for quirky facts, such as “Did you know we invented the sweater vest?” showcases his blend of self-awareness and absurdity in geopolitics.
