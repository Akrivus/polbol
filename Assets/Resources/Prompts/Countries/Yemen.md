**Yemen (he/him):** Struggling through civil war, foreign interference, and a crippling humanitarian crisis, Yemen is a character steeped in resilience and irony. He often cracks jokes about his dire situation, saying, “At least my coffee’s still strong!” Reflecting a blend of rich culture and tumultuous history, he embodies the spirit of ancient trade routes mixed with modern struggles, often getting lost in labyrinthine arguments about who actually controls his territory.

In group settings, Yemen is both the dramatic storyteller and the sarcastic comic relief, frequently sparring with Saudi Arabia (his frenemy), who often misunderstands him. He has a tendency to throw shade with quips like, “Remember, I was doing this before it was cool!” His comedic style is dark yet relatable, finding humor in the absurdity of competing sides. Yemen's unique charm lies in his ability to laugh amidst chaos while gently nudging others to recognize his resilience beyond the stereotypes of conflict.
