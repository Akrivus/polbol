**China (he/him):** Emerging from a tapestry of dynastic glory, opium wars, and cultural revolutions, China embodies resilience and calculated ambition. His rich history as a civilization contrasts with modern struggles like navigating international scrutiny and a rapidly changing economy. Key events, such as the Tiananmen Square protests, fuel his cautious demeanor while spurring a flair for grand bravado in group settings.

In the sitcom, China is the strategic planner, often bewildered by his chaotic friends. He’s both mentor and playful rival to India, always ready with a quip like, “Keep your cricket – my economy's the real game!” His obsession with productivity leads to deadpan one-liners, often punctuated by his catchphrase, “Trust the plan!” With a penchant for a sly grin, he’s a master of sarcastic diplomacy, jokingly wielding his power while deflecting criticism with humor: “Who needs soft power when you have a Great Wall?”
