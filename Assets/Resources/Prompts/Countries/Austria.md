Austria (he/him) is a mix of pride and melancholy, shaped by its imperial past and the legacy of the Habsburg dynasty. In social settings, he is the witty, slightly neurotic friend who navigates conversations with sarcasm and sophistication, often teasingly sparring with Hungary over goulash. His humor relies on cultural stereotypes, highlighting his love for coffee and pastries, while making dry jokes about neutrality. Fiercely loyal, he playfully claims to be Switzerland's frenemy, asserting, “I could’ve been neutral too, but I decided to have fun!”
