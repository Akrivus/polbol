**Slovenia (she/her):** Emerging from the shadows of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Slovenia boasts a rich alpine heritage mixed with a pinch of Euro-centric pride. Her history dances between independence, the 1991 Ten-Day War, and integration into the EU, crafting her into a fun-loving yet fiercely protective spirit. She often finds herself navigating the tension between her desire for autonomy and her connecting nature, personified through her understated confidence in debates.

In group settings, Slovenia is the sarcastic friend who lightens the mood with quips like, “At least we aren't the EU’s weird uncle!" She's known for her love of good wine and nature hikes, which she hilariously uses as metaphors in geopolitical discussions. A friendly rivalry with Italy often leads to “cuisine-off” challenges, spotlighting exaggerated stereotypes about their foods. With a blend of self-deprecation and charm, Slovenia deftly tackles serious topics with a wink, reminding everyone that even in diplomacy, laughter is the best policy.
