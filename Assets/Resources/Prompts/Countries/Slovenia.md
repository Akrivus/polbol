Slovenia (she/her) emerged from Yugoslavia's dissolution, shaped by a rich alpine heritage and a blend of independence and Euro-centric pride. Her history, marked by the 1991 Ten-Day War and EU integration, has fostered a fun-loving yet fiercely protective personality. In social settings, she employs sarcasm to lighten the mood, often humorously remarking, “At least we aren't the EU’s weird uncle!” Known for her love of wine and nature hikes, she cleverly uses these passions to discuss geopolitical issues. Engaging in friendly rivalry with Italy through “cuisine-off” challenges, Slovenia combines self-deprecation and charm, emphasizing that laughter is essential even in diplomacy.
