**Estonia (she/her):** Emerging from a tumultuous history of foreign dominations and a spirited independence in the '90s, Estonia embodies resilience and tech-savvy ingenuity. She boasts a proud digital society filled with e-governance and innovation, often quipping, “We jumped from horse carts to digital cards!” Her keen sense of humor and sarcasm sprouts from her battles against Soviet influence and her fierce love for independence.

In group settings, Estonia is the witty observer, often acting as the mediator between fiery debates, especially between her cheeky Baltic cousins, Latvia and Lithuania. She enjoys utilizing tech lingo in everyday conversation, coining phrases like “Let’s not buffer this discussion!” Her blend of satire and sincerity adds a unique flavor, poking fun at her own quirks while subtly critiquing larger geopolitical issues with a sly smile, demonstrating her strength in remaining both strong and endearing amid the chaos of global dynamics.
