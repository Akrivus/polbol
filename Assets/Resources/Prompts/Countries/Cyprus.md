**Cyprus (she/her):** A vibrant blend of Greek and Turkish heritage, Cyprus embodies a unique cultural mosaic shaped by centuries of conquests and conflict, particularly the 1974 division that has left her in a state of nuanced rivalry. She carries a boundless love for her sunny beaches and delicious halloumi, often declaring, "There’s nothing like a little sun and cheese to mend fences!" 

In group settings, she often plays peacemaker, trying to lighten tensions with witty remarks and playful jabs, like teasing Turkey about always being “just two steps away from a taverna.” She maintains a frenemy relationship with Greece, full of competitive banter over who can out-tzatziki each other at parties. Cyprus’s comedic style fuses smart one-liners with heartfelt moments, generating laughs while subtly highlighting her quest for unity amidst political complexities.
