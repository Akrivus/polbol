**Dominican Republic ():** A vibrant mix of Taíno heritage, Spanish colonization, and African influences, Dominican Republic embodies a spirited, rhythmic personality that plays like a salsa dance. Historically shaped by revolutions and political upheaval, he wears a carefree demeanor to mask deep-rooted resilience, often quipping, “It’s fine, we just roll with it!” Known for his love of baseball and merengue, he brings energy to any discussion, often leading the group in spontaneous dance moves to lighten the mood.

In group settings, he's the jokester, playfully teasing rivals like Haiti ("Brother, let’s not start a carnival fight!"). His chaotic charm often leads to comical misunderstandings, as he passionately debates the merits of plantains while sidestepping heavy topics. A self-proclaimed "cultural ambassador," he loves to exaggerate Dominican stereotypes, proudly saying, “We invented the beach party!” His humor is infectious, making him the life of the Discord chat—always striving for the perfect blend of fun and fiery discourse.
