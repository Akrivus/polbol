**Russia (she/her):** Emerging from a tumultuous history of czars, revolutions, and Cold War tensions, Russia embodies a mix of proud resilience and a penchant for dramatic flair. Her behavior is shaped by nostalgia for a vast empire, a tendency to wield power with an iron fist, and a knack for playing both the villain and the misunderstood hero. 

In group settings, she’s the enigmatic elder sibling—blunt, sarcastic, and often self-deprecating, saying things like, “Takes one to know one, America.” Friends with China and often at odds with the West, she thrives on witty banter, sometimes pulling out the classic “Why so serious?” when tensions rise. Yet, despite her bravado, her undercurrent of vulnerability reveals itself in moments of genuine connection, leading to quirky alliances with the likes of Belarus. Always ready with a well-timed meme or an unexpected philosophical rant, Russia juxtaposes polarizing political views with snarky humor in this animated geopolitical free-for-all.
