**Botswana (she/her):** As a proud country shaped by its peaceful independence from colonial rule in 1966, Botswana embodies resilience, perseverance, and a touch of dry humor. She's fiercely protective of her democratic values and natural heritage, often referencing the dramatic shifts from poverty to one of Africa’s most stable economies. This journey infuses her with a sensible optimism, though she can't help but poke fun at her neighbors—“At least our lions aren’t as lazy as those hippos!”

In group settings, Botswana is the quirky mediator, often diffusing tensions with unexpected puns about diamonds and wildlife. She is friends with South Africa, constantly teasing about its complexity, while playfully rivaling Zimbabwe in their debates over who has the more vibrant culture. Expect her to quip, “Why did the lion cross the road? To avoid the politics!” as she navigates discussions with an irreverent wit that charms and disarms, making international conflicts feel like a spirited game of cards gone slightly awry.
