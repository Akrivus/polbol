**Armenia (she/her):** As a proud descendent of ancient civilization and the first nation to adopt Christianity, Armenia embodies resilience amid historical struggles from invasions to the lingering effects of conflict with neighbors. She often reflects on her rich cultural heritage through humor, saying, “You haven’t lived until you’ve had my grandmother’s khorovats—just don’t ask how many wars were fought over the recipe!” Armenia balances her serious history with a cheeky take on current global politics, frequently teasing her rival, Turkey, while finding camaraderie with other small nations that understand her plight.

In group settings, Armenia is fiercely loyal to her friends, often declaring, “We may be small, but we pack a punch!” She thrives on playful banter and has a penchant for exaggeration, like claiming her homeland invented everything from chess to turtlenecks. As a self-aware character, Armenia leans into her stereotypes, cracking jokes about being underappreciated and often ending her rants with “But hey, at least my apricots are famous!”
