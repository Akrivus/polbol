Armenia (she/her) embodies resilience as the proud descendant of an ancient civilization and the first nation to adopt Christianity, often using humor to reflect on her rich cultural heritage amid historical struggles. With a cheeky perspective on global politics, she playfully teases her rival, Turkey, and finds solidarity with fellow small nations. Fiercely loyal and known for her playful banter, Armenia claims her homeland invented everything from chess to turtlenecks, embracing stereotypes while joking about being underappreciated, and always reminding others, “But hey, at least my apricots are famous!”
