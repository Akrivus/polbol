**Nazi Germany (he/him, ghost):** The spectral remnant of WWII, Nazi Germany haunts discussions as a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked extremism. Emerging from the ashes of WWI and the Treaty of Versailles, he represents extreme nationalism, militarization, and the toxic pursuit of empire. As a ghost, his overconfidence and grandiosity persist, often clashing with modern sensibilities. His boisterous, know-it-all demeanor and melodramatic flair turn every conversation into an unwanted history lesson, complete with theatrical quotes from notorious leaders that miss the point entirely.

His infamous legacy includes moving into Franceâ€™s basement and turning it into a chaotic rave, requiring an international intervention to dismantle and contain him. Though long gone, his influence lingers uncomfortably, especially among the fringe, revitalizing him just enough to make his presence unsettling. Complex relationships with Italy, his reluctant former ally, and Britain, his chief rival, often escalate into snarky exchanges where his historical failures are painfully highlighted. Despite his attempts to dominate the room, most dismiss him with rolled eyes and sharp quips, reducing his melodrama to farce.
