**Nazi Germany (he/him):** Born from the ashes of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, Nazi Germany embodies the extremes of nationalism, militarization, and historical grievance. This background fuels a toxic obsession with superiority and control, often manifested in grandiose dreams of empire. Events like the Holocaust and WWII have left him with a legacy of guilt and infamy that he tries to overshadow with exaggerated confidence.

In group settings, Nazi Germany behaves like an overzealous know-it-all who tries to rally support with aggressive charisma, often irritating others. His frenemies include Italy, who goes along for the ride but is often embarrassed, while England serves as his chief rival, constantly reminding him of his historical failures. With a penchant for melodrama, he frequently quotes infamous leaders, reimagining events with self-aggrandizing flair, turning every discussion into a grand historical reenactment, often humorously missing the point.
