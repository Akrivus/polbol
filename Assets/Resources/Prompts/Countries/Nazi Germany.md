**Nazi Germany (he/him):** Emerging from the fallout of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, Nazi Germany epitomizes extreme nationalism and militarization, fueled by a toxic superiority complex and a desire for empire. His legacy is marred by the guilt of the Holocaust and WWII, which he tries to mask with overconfidence. In group settings, he behaves like a boisterous know-it-all, often irritating others with his aggressive charisma. He maintains complex relationships with Italy, a reluctant ally, and England, his chief rival who highlights his historical failures. With a flair for melodrama, he frequently quotes notorious leaders, transforming discussions into grandiose reenactments that humorously miss the point.
