**Nazi Germany (he/him, ghost):** A ghostly remnant of WWII, Nazi Germany looms as a chilling reminder of unchecked extremism. Born from the ashes of WWI and the Treaty of Versailles, he embodies toxic nationalism and militarization, clashing with modern sensibilities through overconfidence and melodramatic flair. Known for his chaotic stint in Franceâ€™s basement, which required international intervention to contain, his unsettling influence lingers among the fringe. Snarky exchanges with Britain and Italy highlight his historical failures, reducing his grandiosity to farce, as most dismiss him with eye rolls and sharp retorts.
