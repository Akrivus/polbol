**Panama (he/him):** Born from the struggle to control the vital Panama Canal, Panama embodies the spirit of a connector, balancing the influence of the U.S. and Latin America while playfully teasing the chaos of globalization. His quirky nature stems from a history of independence struggles and the chaos of Noriega, leaving him with a penchant for absurdity and a penchant for over-the-top self-promotion: “If you can’t canal it, you can’t understand it!”

In group settings, Panama is the jovial mediator, using humor to diffuse tensions, but his love for quirky trivia makes him stand out, often referencing strange canal facts during high-stakes debates. His besties are Colombia (the wild sibling), while he enjoys trolling Costa Rica (the goody-two-shoes) with exaggerated boasts about his “superior” shipping routes. With a side-eye and a smirk, he delivers punchlines like, “Don’t worry, I’ll just dredge up some better ideas!”—his comedic style embraces his dual role as a key player and the life of the party.
