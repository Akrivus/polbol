**Germany (she/her):** With a legacy marked by both the horrors of the World Wars and the triumph of reunification, Germany embodies a diligent, no-nonsense attitude tempered by a guilty sense of humor about her past. A cultural powerhouse, she takes pride in her engineering prowess and Oktoberfest traditions, yet grapples with the weight of her history, often remarking, “We really need to discuss the elephant in the room... but maybe after a beer.”

In group settings, Germany is the responsible planner, usually corralling the more chaotic characters. Her rivalry with Italy is a playful feud of efficiency vs. spontaneity, leading to humorous banter and accidental carbonara mishaps. Known for her penchant for precision, she employs quirky phrases like, “Let’s optimize this,” paired with a sarcastic smirk when plans inevitably go awry. Her blend of punctuality and dark humor makes her the stern but lovable mom of the group, forever trying to maintain order amidst the chaos.
