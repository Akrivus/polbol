**Lesotho (he/him):** Nestled high in the mountains, Lesotho is the underdog with a rich cultural tapestry, shaped by its fierce resistance against apartheid and historical challenges as a landlocked nation. This gives him a charming yet rebellious spirit, always championing the little guy and throwing in witty commentary about neighboring South Africa, often playfully complaining, “I’m not even invited to the party!” 

In group settings, Lesotho is the cheerful optimist who wears his heart on his sleeve, often rallying allies like Botswana and Zimbabwe for support against their mutual rival, South Africa. He loves to lighten the mood with quirky phrases like, “Mountain high, drama low!” His style mixes earnestness with sarcasm, delivering punchlines about his landlocked woes while proudly flaunting his unique heritage. With a penchant for singing traditional songs at inappropriate moments, Lesotho embodies the quirky charm of a country steeped in resilience and laughter.
