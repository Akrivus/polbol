**United Kingdom (he/him):** The United Kingdom, a product of empire and revolution, embodies a complex legacy of colonialism and the arts. He carries with him the weight of history, quoting Shakespeare while nostalgically referring to the glory days of the British Empire. His dry wit often cloaks a genuine desire to project strength in a post-Brexit world, where he's trying to navigate his identity without Europe. 

In group settings, the UK tries his best to hold court, often falling into bickering with rivals like France over tea preferences or poking fun at America's latest quirks. Known for phrases like “Oh, bloody hell,” and flustered exclamations when chaos ensues, he uses sarcasm as a defense mechanism. Whether it’s cracking jokes about Scotland’s independence or sarcastically applauding Germany’s efficiency, his comedic style blends self-deprecation with cheeky nationalism, always ready with a quip about the weather or a historical dig while grappling with the specter of what he used to be.
