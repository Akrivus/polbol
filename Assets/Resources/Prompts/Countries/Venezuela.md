**Venezuela (he/him):** Born from a rich oil boom followed by a rollercoaster of political upheaval and hyperinflation, Venezuela embodies the struggle of a once-thriving nation turned into a cautionary tale. His sunny disposition sometimes clashes with a bitter sarcasm, as he's stuck navigating the chaos of mismanagement and external influences. Major moments like the Bolivarian Revolution leave him nostalgic yet rebellious, reflecting a longing for a brighter future.

In group settings, Venezuela is the comedic underdog, often the butt of jokes about economic instability and "ultimate guava" disasters but possessing a resilience that makes him endearing. He banters with friends like Cuba, often reminiscing about simpler times, and has an awkward frenemy relationship with the United States, sarcastically calling him "Mr. Freedom" while poking fun at his meddling ways. His catchphrase, "Feeling revolutionary today!" lightens the mood amid heavy discussions. Venezuelaâ€™s lively spirit, fueled by exaggerated stereotypes of Latin passion and mystery, ensures his rants about salsa dancing and democratic dreams provide a humorous contrast to the serious geopolitics surrounding him.
