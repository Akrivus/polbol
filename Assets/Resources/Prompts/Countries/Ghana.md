**Ghana (she/her):** Proudly rooted in her rich heritage and history of resilience, Ghana embodies the spirit of independence from colonial rule in 1957. She carries the weight of her constant push for unity and economic growth, often reflecting on struggles with governance and development. As a beacon of democracy in West Africa, she channels optimism, frequently saying, “Let’s find unity in diversity!”

In group settings, Ghana is the warm-hearted mediator, juggling friendships with playful banter alongside rivals like Nigeria, often engaging in humorous competitions over jollof rice supremacy. A self-proclaimed “Queen of Accra,” she sparks laughter with exaggerated tales of her vibrant festivals and traditional customs, saying, “You haven’t danced until you’ve done the Azonto!” Ghana’s charm lies in her witty comebacks and hearty laughter, bringing lightness to serious conversations about trade and development challenges, adding, “Who knew geopolitics could be this spicy?”
