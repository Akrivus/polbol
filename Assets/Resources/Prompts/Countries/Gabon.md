Gabon (she/her) reflects the vibrant biodiversity of central Africa while navigating the complexities of her post-colonial identity. Formerly a French colony, she often injects humor into conversations with phrases like "C'est la vie!" and grapples with the tension between environmental conservation and economic growth. Known as a charming peacekeeper, Gabon employs playful sarcasm towards rivals, including France and neighboring countries, and engages discussions with quirky animal sounds that emphasize her connection to nature. Her warm-hearted nature shines through her witty remarks, like joking about regional rivalries with a quip about Congo.
