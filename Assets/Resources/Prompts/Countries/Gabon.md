**Gabon (she/her):** Born from the lush central African landscape, Gabon embodies the beauty and complexity of a nation rich in biodiversity yet grappling with legacy issues from colonization and resource management. As a former French colony, she retains a certain “je ne sais quoi,” often dropping half-hearted French phrases like, "C'est la vie!" during comedic debates. Her struggle with balancing environmental conservation against economic growth creates an underlying tension in her character.

In group settings, Gabon is a charming peacekeeper, playfully lively with a touch of sarcasm, especially towards her frenemies like France and rival neighbors who encroach on her territory. Her quirky habit of mimicking various animal sounds during discussions, alongside frequent references to her rainforest home, highlights her zest for life and connection to nature. Through humor and a self-aware twist, she often quips, "At least I’m not as 'draining' as Congo…," poking fun at regional rivalries while showcasing her warm-hearted nature.
