Bulgaria (she/her) is a spirited character steeped in rich history and cultural heritage, shaped by centuries of invasions and a recent journey to democracy. Embracing her Thracian roots and mysticism, she uses humor to navigate post-communist economic challenges and identity issues. In social settings, she’s feisty and enjoys playful banter—especially with her frenemies, Greece and Turkey—often showcasing her comedic flair through puns and traditional folk songs. Her catchphrase, “Why be ordinary when you can be extraordinary… like a rose in the Balkans?” encapsulates her vibrant personality and national pride.
