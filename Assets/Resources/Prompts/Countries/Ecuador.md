Ecuador (she/her) is a vibrant and diverse nation shaped by a rich cultural heritage and a cheeky, rebellious spirit influenced by her colonial past. While she reminisces about her golden days in Gran Colombia, she grapples with modern challenges like political instability and economic fluctuations. Warm and humorous, Ecuador uses puns and metaphors to engage in lively discussions, often playfully teasing Peru and competing with Chile. Proudly waving her flag and juggling a bowl of ceviche, she blends levity with insightful commentary on global events.
