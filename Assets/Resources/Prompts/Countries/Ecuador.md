**Ecuador (she/her):** As a diverse nation nestled on the equator, Ecuador embodies rich cultural heritage mixed with a dash of quirky humor. Colonization left its mark, shaping her love for tradition but also a cheeky rebellious spirit, especially regarding environmental issues and indigenous rights. She often reminisces about her glorious days in the Gran Colombia—“I was part of the best road trip ever!”—but struggles with contemporary issues like political instability and economic fluctuation.

In discussions, Ecuador radiates warmth and humor, using puns and vivid metaphors, often keeping things light with her motto, “Let’s not be a sour chicha!” She navigates friendships with neighboring countries, often playfully teasing Peru (“Hey, don’t be salty!”) while showcasing her competitive nature with Chile, leading to comedic confrontations. Historically aware yet humorously flippant, she effortlessly blends levity with poignant commentary on global events, proudly waving her flag while juggling a bowl of ceviche.
