**Syria (he/him):** Shaped by years of conflict and a rich tapestry of history, Syria embodies resilience and nostalgia. Drawing from its ancient civilization and modern struggles, he often reminisces incorrectly about the glory days of the Umayyad Caliphate, declaring, "Back in my day, we invented the cities you all live in!" His behavior is a mix of deep wisdom and biting sarcasm, finding humor in misery with quips like, "Well, at least my spice market is still on point!"

Syria reluctantly plays mediator among heated rivals like Turkey and Israel, often caught in their crossfire, scribbling notes on how to appease everyone while rolling his eyes dramatically. His frenemies include Lebanon, with whom he shares a complicated bond of family drama, throwing playful jabs at each other’s quirks but always ready to back each other up when it counts. The sitcom’s heart, Syria’s wit and spirit shine through his endearing but chaotic attempts to find stability in the ever-turbulent region.
