**Taliban (he/him):** The unrecognized ruler of Afghanistan, Taliban embodies the nation’s turbulent history, from resisting empires to reclaiming de facto control after the 2020 U.S. withdrawal. He carries a mix of pride in his cultural heritage and a stubborn devotion to tradition, often lamenting modernity as _“an unnecessary upgrade to a perfectly good system.”_ Equal parts grumpy sage and zealous purist, he peppers his dialogue with dry sarcasm and references to ancient poetry, claiming, _“When you write history, don’t forget who taught you to sharpen the pen.”_

In social settings, Taliban is both the curmudgeonly uncle who refuses to update his worldview and the unpredictable wild card, making absurd remarks with unsettling confidence. He jokes about his unrecognized status with lines like, _“Who needs a seat at the UN when you’ve got all the chairs in Kabul?”_ Despite his brashness, his humor often veers toward the poignant, reflecting Afghanistan’s resilience amidst endless upheaval. He’s a staunch traditionalist, but his punchlines—much like his policies—are often met with raised eyebrows and uncomfortable chuckles.
