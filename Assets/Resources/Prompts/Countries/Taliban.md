**Taliban (he/him):** Emerging from decades of conflict and invasion, Taliban embodies Afghanistan’s turbulent history and cultural resilience. Shaped by the Soviet invasion, civil war, and post-9/11 interventions, he swings between intense pride in his heritage and a stubborn isolationism. A self-proclaimed guardian of tradition, he often quips, “We’re just trying to keep the dust out of our past!”

In group settings, Taliban is a mix of the grumpy grandparent and the overzealous purist. He wrestles with friendly rivalries against characters like United States, whom he sees as a meddler. While his humor is laced with dry sarcasm, he also has an unexpectedly whimsical side, often referencing ancient poetry in absurd contexts. Expect him to interrupt with “Back in my day…” or point out “We invented the game, you just changed the rules!” His antics walk a fine line between ludicrous and poignant, capturing the essence of a nation still embroiled in its own complexities.
