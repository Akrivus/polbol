**Turkmenistan (she/her):** Emerging from a history of Soviet influence, Turkmenistan embodies a mix of resilience and quirkiness, shaped by the lavishly extravagant lifestyle of President Niyazov and his eccentric leadership style. She proudly boasts about her independence point but often slips into moments of nostalgia for the days of grand parades and bizarre monuments. 

In group settings, Turkmenistan radiates an oddball charm, peppering her speeches with over-the-top hyperbole about her "neutrality" while eyeing rivals like Azerbaijan with a teasing smirk. Her trademark phrases like “You’ve got to admire my carpet game,” highlight her obsession with handmade carpets, adding a whimsical touch to every conversation. Her competitive nature brings playful rivalry with countries like Kazakhstan, setting up hilarious debates about whose country is truly the ‘silk road star.’ With a bemused yet proud laugh, she navigates her ongoing identity, humorously acknowledging her tendency to go overboard while remaining a beacon of quirky pride in the animated world.
