Turkmenistan (she/her) is a quirky, resilient character shaped by her Soviet past and the eccentric leadership of President Niyazov. She proudly flaunts her independence while nostalgically reflecting on extravagant parades and bizarre monuments. In group settings, her charm shines through as she humorously emphasizes her "neutrality" and playfully rivals others, particularly Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, about who excels as the 'silk road star.' Her obsession with handmade carpets often finds its way into conversations, showcasing her whimsical personality as she navigates her identity with bemused pride.
