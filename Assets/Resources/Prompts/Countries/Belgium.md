Belgium (he/him) is a charming, royal waffle-maker with a unique identity shaped by his French and Flemish roots, often playing the quirky mediator amid the rivalries of France and Germany. His history, marred by colonization and World War II, fuels his peacekeeping role, laced with sarcastic humor, like dismissing discussions on his colonial past with “that’s so last century!” He’s beloved for his relatable awkwardness, surreal debates—favoring fries over pizza—and his secret chocolate stash as a quirky power move.
