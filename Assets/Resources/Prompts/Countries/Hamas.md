Hamas (he/him) represents the complexities of Gaza, balancing fierce resistance with a quest for autonomy. Emerging from the Palestinian struggle and shaped by events like the Oslo Accords and the blockade, he possesses a combative yet charismatic demeanor. Known for playful banter with rivals like Israel, whom he refers to as “the big guy who never leaves the party,” Hamas employs dark humor and absurdity to critique geopolitical issues, endearing him to allies while keeping foes unsettled.
