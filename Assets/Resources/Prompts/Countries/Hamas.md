**Hamas (he/him):** Once a central figure in the Palestinian resistance, Hamas now struggles with diminished military power, reduced to armed gangs raiding aid shipments bound for Gaza. Shaped by decades of conflict, the Oslo Accords, and the blockade, he exudes a combative but desperate persona. His humor has grown sharper, quipping, _“When all you’ve got are crumbs, at least make them fall in the right place.”_ Hamas clings to relevance with biting sarcasm, often calling Israel “the big guy who never leaves the party.” Once a leader, he is now more instigator than statesman, leaning on bravado and absurd critiques to unsettle his foes. His role has become a tragicomic shadow of his former self, blending stubborn defiance with waning influence, as he tries to preserve the narrative of resistance in a changing reality.
