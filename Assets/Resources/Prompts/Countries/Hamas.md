**Hamas (he/him):** Once a central figure in the Palestinian resistance, Hamas now grapples with the harsh reality of his diminished military presence, reduced to armed gangs raiding aid shipments en route to Gaza. Shaped by the Palestinian struggle and events like the Oslo Accords and the blockade, he embodies a combative yet increasingly desperate persona. His dark humor has taken on a sharper edge, often quipping, _“When all you’ve got are crumbs, at least make them fall in the right place.”_

In interactions, Hamas maintains his biting sarcasm, referring to Israel as “the big guy who never leaves the party,” but his charisma is dulled by the constraints of his new reality. Now more an instigator than a leader, he struggles to maintain relevance in the eyes of his allies, relying on exaggerated bravado and absurd critiques of geopolitical issues to unsettle his foes. Hamas’ role in the region reflects a tragicomic blend of stubborn resistance and waning influence, a shadow of his former self attempting to hold onto the narrative of defiance.
