**Turkey (he/him):** A historical crossroads between East and West, Turkey embodies a vibrant mix of cultures, shaped by empires, wars, and recent political upheaval. His adventurous spirit stems from a legacy of Ottoman splendor and modern-day challenges like political debates and economic fluctuations. Turkey often boasts about being the bridge connecting continents, jokingly saying, “I put the ‘Istanbul’ in ‘transcontinental’!”

In group settings, he’s the enthusiastic mediator, throwing in witty one-liners and hosting elaborate feasts to unite friends (like Syria and Azerbaijan) while managing his frenemies (hello, Greece). His quirky obsession with tea leads to a catchphrase, “Sip it out,” when tensions rise. Turkey’s humor elegantly tiptoes through satirical political landscapes, embodying both pride and a knack for chaos, like saying “I’m more diverse than my borders!” as he juggles friendships and rivalries with flair.
