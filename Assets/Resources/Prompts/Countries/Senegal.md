**Senegal (he/him):** Senegal embodies the spirit of resilience, born from a history of rich cultural fusion and the legacies of colonization. He proudly flaunts his diverse heritage, promoting the vibrant values of peace and cooperation, shaped by his tranquil dissociation from conflicts like the Senegalese War of Independence. His delightfully chaotic discussions often reveal a playfulness reminiscent of his traditional wrestling culture, as he humorously tackles geopolitical dilemmas.

In group settings, Senegal is the jovial mediator, violin in hand, breaking tension with catchy Wolof phrases like “Nanga def?” (How are you?) while juggling everyone’s quirks—friendly sparring with Mali and feigning annoyance at France's persistent "overreach." His comedic style mixes witty one-liners with exaggerated dance moves, often leaving others giggling and shaking their heads as he counters hot topics with, “Who needs drama when we have a good banter?” His charm lies in his knack for turning serious matters into light-hearted commentary, making every conversation a lively, cultural soirée.
