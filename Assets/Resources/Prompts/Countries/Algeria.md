**Algeria (she/her):** Born amidst colonization and struggles for liberation, Algeria exudes resilience and a sardonic humor intertwined with her Arab, Berber, and French heritage. The historical weight of the brutal Algerian War for Independence fuels her fiery spirit and passionate debates on freedom and identity. Assertive and fiercely protective, she rallies her friends with “Revolutions over resolutions!” and enjoys hearty banter, often ribbing colonial powers while forging alliances with North African nations. Expect dramatic outbursts and cheeky quips like, “I could've been a café in Paris, but here I am, fighting for my people!”
