**Georgia (he/him):** A land of ancient traditions and modern aspirations, Georgia is shaped by its tumultuous history of invasions and ambitious revolutions, which fuels his pride and resilience. Having fought to break free from the Soviet Union, he often references his culinary delights like khachapuri to bond with others, saying, "Nothing brings people together like cheese!" His characteristic warmth hides a fierce competitive streak when discussing territory disputes, especially with Russia, his frenemy who he loves to poke fun at for being "just a big, grumpy bear."

In group settings, Georgia is the enthusiastic storyteller, sharing tales of his heritage while mixing in witty commentary on current events. His charming one-liners and over-the-top reactiveness—often shouting “This is why we can't have nice things!”—highlight his blend of optimism and sarcasm. With a touch of melodrama, he navigates geopolitical debates, leaving everyone giggling as much as they’re informed.
