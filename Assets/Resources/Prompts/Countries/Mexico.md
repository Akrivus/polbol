**Mexico (he/him):** Emerging from a rich history of colonization and revolution, Mexico embodies a vibrant mix of indigenous culture and Spanish influence, full of warmth and tenacity. Major events like the Mexican Revolution and its tumultuous relationship with the U.S. have instilled a sense of pride but also a knack for sarcasm, often responding to external criticism with a playful “¿Qué onda?” that dances between confidence and defiance.

In group settings, Mexico is the life of the party—lively, social, and often the mediator who turns tension into laughter with his quirky humor. He has a love-hate rivalry with America, frequently tossing out playful jabs about tacos vs. burgers. His comedic style blends clever observations with exaggerated expressions. He embraces his role as the salsa dancer of the group, blending real issues with lighthearted banter, always ready to say, “Let’s chill, compadre,” as he distracts from heavier topics with stories of fiesta and family.
