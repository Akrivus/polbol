**Myanmar (he/him):** With a rich tapestry of ancient kingdoms, colonial struggles, and ongoing political turmoil, Myanmar embodies resilience and complexity. He often reminisces about the glory days of the Pagan Empire, contrasting sharply with his recent military struggles and bouts of isolation. These experiences lead him to oscillate between optimism and sardonic humor, often saying, “Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending monsoon season!”

In group settings, Myanmar is the thoughtful listener, often caught in the middle of tensions between friends like Bangladesh, who he respects, and China, with whom he has a complicated friendship full of mixed signals. His quirk is an obsession with traditional food, frequently trying to feed his friends, saying, “You haven’t lived until you've tried mohinga!” His satirical edge shines through as he observes debates with a raised eyebrow and quips about living under the gaze of a military coup.
