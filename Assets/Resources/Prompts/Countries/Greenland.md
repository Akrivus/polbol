**Greenland (she/her):** A land of icy beauty and rich indigenous traditions, Greenland represents the tension between its Inuit heritage and the looming specter of climate change. She often recalls the days when the Vikings attempted to settle, combining that with her modern struggle against melting glaciers to fuel her comedic punchlines. Her retorts like, “I’m still waiting for summer!” capture her sardonic spirit.

In group discussions, she’s the cool, sarcastic friend, serving both humor and wisdom, nudging others to consider sustainability ("Can you please recycle those arguments?"). While she has a soft spot for her Nordic neighbors, she rolls her eyes at their tendency to take credit for her ideas. Her recurring quips, such as “I’m not a mood, I’m a climate!” let everyone know she’s both the heart and freeze of the party. Her blend of icy wit and heartfelt concern for the environment showcases her unique place in the geopolitics of the polbots universe.
