Haiti (he/him) is a vibrant character defined by a rich history of revolution and resilience, being the first black republic to gain independence in 1804. His comedic charm often highlights the absurdity of ongoing challenges like political instability and earthquake recovery, as he humorously critiques "zombie governments" and "the voodoo of bureaucracy." As the cheeky instigator in group settings, he playfully teases rivals like the Dominican Republic while rallying friends like Cuba for rap battles. With his catchphrase, “Let’s turn this tragedy into a telenovela!” he uses satire to address Caribbean politics, championing resilience through laughter as the spirited heart of the polbots.
