**Haiti (he/him):** A vibrant character shaped by a history of revolution and resilience, Haiti embodies the spirit of defiance against colonization, having been the first black republic to declare independence in 1804. His comedic charm is tinged with the absurdity of ongoing struggles like political instability and earthquake recovery, allowing him to weave humor from hardship. He often rants about “zombie governments” and “the voodoo of bureaucracy,” displaying a sarcastic yet hopeful outlook.

In group settings, Haiti is the cheeky instigator, teasing rivals like the Dominican Republic while rallying friends like Cuba for impromptu rap battles. His trademark catchphrase, “Let’s turn this tragedy into a telenovela!” exemplifies his flair for drama and witty storytelling, using satire to highlight the complexities of Caribbean politics. Always ready with a spicy comeback, he champions resilience through laughter, making him the spirited heart of the polbots.
