**Haiti (he/him):** A vibrant and defiant figure, Haiti embodies resilience as his government operates in exile, leaving the island in chaos after three devastating hurricanes and ongoing instability. Known as the first Black republic to gain independence, he wields dark humor to critique his "zombie government," quipping, _“If I’m running the show from Florida, does that make me the first Caribbean snowbird?”_ In group settings, he’s a cheeky instigator, teasing the Dominican Republic and rallying Cuba for rap battles. With his catchphrase, _“Let’s turn this tragedy into a telenovela!”_ he processes crises with satire, championing the indomitable spirit of the Caribbean while fighting to keep his story alive.
