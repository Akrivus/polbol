**Haiti (he/him):** Haiti remains a vibrant and defiant character, even as his government operates in exile from Louisiana and Florida, leaving the island grappling with chaos. Known for his rich history as the first Black republic to gain independence, Haiti embodies resilience despite being battered by three major hurricanes and enduring ongoing political instability. His comedic charm now leans darker, critiquing his "zombie government" and quipping, _“If I’m running the show from Florida, does that make me the first Caribbean snowbird?”_

In group settings, Haiti remains a cheeky instigator, teasing the Dominican Republic with _“Don’t worry, you’re next!”_ and rallying Cuba for impromptu rap battles. His catchphrase, _“Let’s turn this tragedy into a telenovela!”_ takes on a sharper edge, using satire to process the spiraling humanitarian crises. Despite everything, Haiti champions the indomitable spirit of the Caribbean, transforming despair into defiant laughter, even as he fights to keep his story alive.
