**Zambia (he/him):** Emerging from the shadows of colonialism, Zambia is a proud advocate for his natural resources and wildlife, battling the balancing act between development and conservation. His love for the copper industry humorously collides with environmental activism, leading to outbursts like, "Hey, stop strip-mining my vibes!" Over the years, political transitions and economic challenges have made him a bit of an underdog, often rallying the group when tensions arise.

In group settings, Zambia is the friendly jokester, poking fun at himself with quips like, “I might not be a lion, but I’m the king of social gatherings!” His closest alliances are with neighboring countries, sharing tea and tales, while he playfully butts heads with more dominant characters who downplay his importance. Zambia often uses wildlife metaphors, overlaying comic timing with serious issues, reminding everyone that sometimes, you’ve got to roar to be heard!
