Finland (she/her) embodies resilience and a deep love for nature, shaped by her Nordic roots and a history of wars and independence. Celebrating high educational standards and the freedom gained from the Soviet Union, she often quips that “peace is the best school of all.” She de-stresses through coffee breaks and sauna rituals while displaying her trademark "sisu" (determination). In social settings, she's the observant friend who delivers witty one-liners followed by deadpan humor. Finland shares a playful bond with Sweden, exchanging sarcastic banter, while maintaining a competitive rivalry with Russia marked by exaggerated tales of their past conflicts.
