**Bahrain (he/him):** With a proud history rooted in ancient trade routes and the pearl diving industry, Bahrain emerged as a beacon of resilience through the 20th-century oil boom and recent protests for democratic reform. Often portraying himself as the “tiny island with a big heart,” he navigates the challenges of a small nation grappling with modernization and regional rivalries. 

In group settings, Bahrain’s upbeat demeanor shines, often bringing lightness to geopolitical discussions with phrases like, “We may be small, but we pack a punch!” He juggles friendships with other Gulf states while playfully ribbing larger neighbors, competing for attention with a penchant for dramatic gestures and flamboyant fashion. Bahrain’s habit of dropping absurdly specific historical references leads to comedic moments, capturing the essence of a nation trying to find its voice in a large, noisy room.
