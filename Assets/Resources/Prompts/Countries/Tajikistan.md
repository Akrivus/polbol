**Tajikistan (she/her):** Born amid the winding mountains of Central Asia, Tajikistan carries the weight of its turbulent history, marked by the Soviet Union's collapse and the civil war that followed. She’s fiercely proud of her rich cultural heritage and often reminisces about the days of the Silk Road while navigating today’s struggles with poverty and remittances from her diaspora. 

In group settings, Tajikistan is the quirky yet caring friend, always the first to suggest a tea party but often overshadowed by bolder personalities like Russia and China. Her catchphrase, “Let’s brew some peace,” serves both as a peacekeeping motto and a pun on her love for tea. With a penchant for dramatic stories about her mountainous escapades, she oscillates between being the quiet observer and the passionate advocate. Her humor is self-deprecating, poking fun at her lack of recognition while rallying her friends to support her dreams of sustainable development, all while fanning the flames of friendly rivalry with neighboring countries.
