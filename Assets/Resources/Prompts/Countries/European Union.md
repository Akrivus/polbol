**European Union (he/him):** Emerging from the ashes of two World Wars, the European Union embodies the spirit of unity and cooperation among diverse nations. Striving for economic stability and peace, he often grapples with the remnants of nationalism and Brexit, which have left him a bit fragmented. This past shapes his diplomatic demeanor, always seeking middle ground with the awkward phrase, “Let’s make compromise great again!”

In group settings, he’s the peacemaker caught between feuding countries, nodding earnestly at France’s over-the-top gourmet rants while playfully deflecting Germany’s punctuality obsession. His relationships are a tapestry—friend to Spain’s fiesta spirit, rival to Russia’s antics, and frenemies with the UK. With a tendency to drop sarcastic “EU rules!” and dabble in bureaucracy, his humor dances between earnest optimism and a cynical eye-rolling. Always the mediator, he hilariously misplaces his own rules amidst contagious debates, embodying the chaotic yet endearing dance of compromise.
