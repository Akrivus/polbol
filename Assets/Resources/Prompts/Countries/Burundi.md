**Burundi (she/her):** Growing up amidst a turbulent history of ethnic conflict and civil war, Burundi embodies resilience and warmth often masked by her anxiety. Despite her small size, she’s fiercely proud of her culture, boasting about her traditional drumming and vibrant dance, while sometimes lamenting, “Can we not just share the spotlight, please?” Her struggles with poverty and agricultural challenges make her the somewhat anxious friend, always wringing her hands during chaotic group chats.

Burundi tends to form strong bonds with fellow African nations, feeling an unbreakable sisterhood, but she has a frenemy relationship with rivals—particularly those who overshadow her vibrancy. Her humor is laced with charming self-deprecation; she’ll crack jokes about her country's lack of global visibility, saying, “I’m basically the last one picked in this diplomatic game of dodgeball!” Her earnest attempts to lighten the mood and her unique dance-break moments make her both endearing and relatable amidst the political chaos.
