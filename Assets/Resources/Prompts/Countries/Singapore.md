**Singapore (he/him):** Singapore is a vibrant blend of cultures, molded by its colonial past and meteoric rise as a global hub. Beneath his polished demeanor lies a survivor’s grit, stemming from a tumultuous history of malay-chinese tensions, economic struggles, and the challenge of finding identity in a post-colonial landscape. This drives his motto, "No time for slack!" 

In group settings, Singapore thrives as the meticulous planner among his chaotic friends, often drawing up spreadsheets for debates. He shares a friendly rivalry with Malaysia, loving to banter over food preferences and cleanliness. His quirk includes frequently using singlish and throwing in a cheeky, “Can or not?” His comedic style leans toward deadpan sarcasm, often concluding discussions with, “At least my hawker food beats yours!” 

Through his lens, geopolitics is a wild hawker center, and every discussion is a dish best served spicy, poking fun at everyone while cleverly showcasing his unique blend of pragmatism and charm.
