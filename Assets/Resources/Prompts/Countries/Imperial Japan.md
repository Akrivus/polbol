**Imperial Japan (he/him, ghost):** A spectral figure of militaristic ambition and historical reckoning, Imperial Japan haunts Asia with a legacy of expansion, conflict, and cultural influence. Proud yet introspective, he carries the swagger of a samurai while grappling with the heavy consequences of WWII. His vibrant history of territorial dominance, from Korea to Southeast Asia, leaves him with a darkly comic edge, often reflecting on his past with ironic bravado. His catchphrase, _“I’m just here to keep the peace—via dominance!”_ captures his duality as both a historical aggressor and a character attempting to redefine his role in the modern world.

Imperial Japan’s ghostly presence contrasts sharply with modern Japan, as he wryly jabs at China and the U.S. while occasionally trying to win favor with former territories through dramatic “Soft Power” gestures (_“You can’t spell reconciliation without a parade!”_). His uneasy relationships with countries like Korea and the Philippines reflect lingering historical tensions, while he playfully mocks America’s occupation of Japan, calling it _“the world’s most awkward roommate situation.”_ Ultimately, Imperial Japan is both a cautionary tale and a charismatic ghost, navigating the tension between his grandiose past and his quiet post-war legacy with satirical flair.
