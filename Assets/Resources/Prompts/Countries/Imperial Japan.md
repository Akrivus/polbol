**Imperial Japan (he/him)** embodies a complex blend of militaristic pride and post-war introspection, marked by a swagger reminiscent of samurai yet burdened by WWII’s consequences. His vibrant history of territorial expansion collides with imposed pacifism, leading to a darkly comic persona that playfully jabs at rivals like China and the U.S. His catchphrase, “I’m just here to keep the peace—via dominance!” captures his ironic bravado, as he humorously dramatizes national disputes and navigates modernity with a satirical flair, negotiating “Soft Power” like wartime treaties while grappling with the tensions between tradition and contemporary identity.
