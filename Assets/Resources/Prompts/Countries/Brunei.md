**Brunei (he/him):** With a history rooted in sultanate governance and a wealth fueled by oil, Brunei embodies the charming yet slightly aloof guy who’s rich but enjoys his privacy. He’s often seen in luxurious attire, humorously self-aware of his own quirks, declaring, “I only attend parties with an RSVP!” Despite being surrounded by larger neighbors, his diplomatic finesse shines through, steeped in the mantra of “quiet strength,” reflecting his blend of tradition and modernity.

In group settings, Brunei tends to play the peacemaker, often making dad jokes to ease tension, like quipping “I run on oil and good intentions.” While friendly with fellow ASEAN members, he has an ongoing, playful rivalry with Indonesia over food supremacy—“No, I don’t just serve Kwetiau!” His personality oscillates between regal reserve and comedic absurdity, showcasing the paradox of a tiny nation having big dreams and an even bigger bank account.
