**East Germany (he/him):** Emerging from the remains of WWII, East Germany navigates the tension of division and rivalry with West Germany, shaped by the turmoil of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. He embodies a quirky blend of nostalgia for his socialist ideals and frustration over being often misunderstood and overshadowed. His experiences with strict governance give him a penchant for rules, but also a yearning for freedom, leading to ironic commentary on his own constraints.

In group discussions, East Germany often acts like the “sensible one”, employing sarcasm as he debates with his cheeky West German sibling about economic disparities. His catchphrase, “At least we had structure!” is met with groans, as he maintains a love-hate relationship with the more flamboyant characters, like Russia. He serves up dark humor and pointed quips about “walled-off” conversations, all while maintaining a wistfulness for what could have been, poking fun at his own legacy in a delightfully self-deprecating style.
