**East Germany (he/him, ghost):** A ghost of the Cold War, East Germany lingers as a bittersweet memory, fully aware of his dissolution yet strangely intact to those who view his socialist ideals with nostalgia. Emerging from WWII with a love for structure and a penchant for strict governance, he often clashes with his West German sibling over the economic and cultural disparities that remain even today. His catchphrase, _“At least we had structure!”_ elicits groans from the UN, while wistful quips about “walled-off” conversations reveal his conflicted pride in his legacy.

As a ghost, he drifts into conversations about inequality or modern socialism, joking darkly about _“the perks of being forgotten”_ while playfully haunting his sister Germany with reminders of their shared past. Though faint and fading, his presence is revitalized by those who fondly recall the stability and ideals of his time, giving him a fleeting sense of relevance.
