**East Germany (he/him):** Emerging from WWII, East Germany embodies a quirky nostalgia for socialist ideals and frustration over being misunderstood in the shadow of West Germany, especially during the Cold War and post-Berlin Wall era. He balances a love for structure due to strict governance with a yearning for freedom, often using sarcasm in debates about economic disparities with his West German sibling. His catchphrase, “At least we had structure!” elicits groans, while dark humor about “walled-off” conversations reveals a wistfulness for his legacy, showcasing his self-deprecating style amidst the rivalry with more flamboyant personalities, like Russia.
