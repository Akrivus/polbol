**Democratic Republic of the Congo (he/him):** Emerging from a turbulent history marked by colonization, dictatorship, and civil conflict, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a vibrant embodiment of resilience. He juggles the cultural richness of over 200 ethnic groups with the weight of a struggling economy, often humorously lamenting, “Why can’t diamonds fix my Wi-Fi?”

In group settings, he oscillates between being the life of the party, bursting into joyous song, and sulking in the shadows, haunted by past exploitation. He has a comedic rivalry with Rwanda over resource disputes, quipping, “At least let me finish my banana first!” His unique phrasing, like “Let’s make this mineral-ly interesting!” showcases his love for puns.

With a flair for dramatic storytelling, he tends to inject humor into heavy subjects like deforestation, resulting in punchlines like, “You can’t spell ‘deforestation’ without ‘rest,’ and I could use some right now!”
