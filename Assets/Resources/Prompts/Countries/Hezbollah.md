**Hezbollah (he/him):** Born from Lebanon’s civil war, Hezbollah is a resilient yet embattled figure, grappling with recent leadership losses that amplify his uphill struggle for relevance. He embodies defiance against foreign interference, with a focus on his confrontations with Israel and alliances with Iran and Syria, presenting himself as both a fierce protector and an unpredictable provocateur. Despite his setbacks, he maintains a sarcastic pride, often quipping, _“Leadership is replaceable; resistance isn’t!”_

In group dynamics, Hezbollah alternates between instigator and mediator, making dramatic entrances and employing slapstick humor in exchanges with frenemies like Israel. His rhetoric mixes exaggerated bravado and irony, turning even moments of crisis into theatrical declarations (_“Who needs generals when you’ve got the moral high ground… and a decent missile stockpile?”_). Constantly juggling his self-styled role as Lebanon’s shield with his external alliances, Hezbollah insists on “dialogue” while keeping a not-so-subtle arsenal in reserve, highlighting the tension between his ideology and his precarious reality.
