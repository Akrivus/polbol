**Hezbollah (he/him):** Born from Lebanon's civil war, Hezbollah is a complex figure marked by resilience and a dual identity as a fierce protector and a mischievous provocateur. He embodies defiance against foreign interference, notably in his confrontations with Israel and alliances with Iran and Syria, showcasing pride tempered with sarcasm. In group dynamics, he oscillates between instigator and mediator, making dramatic entrances and employing humor in his slapstick exchanges with frenemies, often blending irony with exaggerated rhetoric, all while claiming a desire for "considerate dialogueâ€¦ with a side of rocket launchers!"
