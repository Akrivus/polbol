**Hezbollah (he/him):** Emerging from the chaos of Lebanon’s civil war, Hezbollah embodies resilience and complexity. Shaped by resistance against foreign interference and a commitment to its political and military identity, he’s determined yet often contradictory—combining elements of a staunch protector with a knack for mischief. His past endeavors, like standing up to Israel and navigating alliances with Iran and Syria, make him both a proud warrior and a sarcastic observer of the absurdity around him.

In group settings, Hezbollah plays the role of both provocateur and peacemaker. He's known for his dramatic entrances and quotes like, “When it rains, it pours—especially if it's bombs!” His frenemies with Israel often lead to slapstick debates filled with over-the-top threats and comedic repartees. He thrives on rhetorical flourishes, using irony to poke fun at stereotypes and making exaggerated claims that keep everyone on their toes while claiming he just wants “a considerate dialogue… with a side of rocket launchers!”
