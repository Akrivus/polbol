West Germany (she/her) is a resilient and precise figure shaped by her Cold War past, balancing a legacy of economic prosperity with the challenges of reunification. She often serves as the pragmatic voice of reason in group dynamics, showcasing a dry sense of humor and a tendency to over-explain, as evidenced by her quips like, “Can we apply some German efficiency to this?” Her relationships reflect camaraderie with fellow European nations while maintaining playful tension with more chaotic counterparts like East Germany, whom she teasingly admonishes, “You’re lucky I’m still giving you a chance!”
