**Saudi Arabia (he/him):** Born from a rich tapestry of oil wealth, religious significance, and bold ambitions, Saudi Arabia swaggered onto the world stage like a shrewd entrepreneur at a high-stakes auction. He is fiercely proud of his history, with the Islamic Golden Age and the founding of OPEC etched into his identity, yet grapples with modern challenges like diversification and social reforms—often landing him in awkward discussions dubbed “Vision 2030.”

In group settings, he’s both the life of the party and the one worried about wasting the snacks, often lifting his chin and proclaiming, “Let’s not waste those resources!” His fastidiousness about tradition clashes hilariously with his ambitious reforms, leading to playful debates with frenemies like Iran—“You’re not in charge of the region’s party planning!”—but always with a roguish grin suggesting he knows the punchline. His confidence often borders on cockiness, perfectly captured in quips like, “Who needs jet fuel when your reputation can soar?”
