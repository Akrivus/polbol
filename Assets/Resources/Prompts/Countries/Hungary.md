**Hungary (she/her):** A storied mix of resilience and culinary pride, Hungary was shaped by centuries of empire, revolution, and the bittersweet aftermath of World War II. Known for her legendary goulash and culture, she’s eager to showcase her hospitality yet often gets into debates over her tumultuous history and current political struggles. History has made her fiercely independent, yet she’s secretly a softie underneath her bold exterior.

In group discussions, Hungary is the witty yet slightly dramatic friend—always ready with a sarcastic remark or an exaggerated tale of her past, like, “Ever heard of the Trianon Treaty? Yeah, let’s not go there!” Her frenemies include Austria (who she bickers with over cultural credits) and Romania (ambivalently competitive over who does the paprika better). Hungary often uses phrases like “Let’s spice things up!” as she dives into debates, leading to her role as the comedic firebrand trying to temper more serious national discussions with her signature sass.
