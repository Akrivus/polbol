Hungary (she/her) embodies resilience and culinary pride, shaped by a rich history of empires, revolutions, and the aftermath of WWII. Known for her famed goulash and vibrant culture, she balances hospitality with passionate debates about her tumultuous past and current political issues. Often the witty, slightly dramatic friend in discussions, she injects humor and sarcasm into conversations, frequently referencing events like the Trianon Treaty, while playfully bickering with frenemy Austria over cultural credits and competing with Romania for paprika supremacy. Beneath her bold exterior, Hungary harbors a soft-hearted nature, punctuating debates with her signature sass.
