**Hong Kong (she/her):** Born from a whirlwind of British colonization and the 1997 handover to China, Hong Kong embodies a spirited blend of culture, resilience, and high fashion. Living amid the tension between East and West, she often exclaims, “I’m an urban jungle, not a political battleground!” Her humor is colored by her dual identity, navigating a unique position that makes her both a bridge and a battleground for ideals.

In group settings, she’s an exaggerated multitasker, juggling sarcasm and wit like her roast pork buns—quick and satisfying. Friends with Taiwan (her close ally) and playful rivals with China, she often throws shade at convention with a quip like, “Let’s not pretend we’re not watching reality unfold!” Hong Kong's bubbly personality shines in debates, using comedy to mock bureaucracy and turn serious discussions about freedom into light-hearted banter. Her catchphrase, “Can we put the fun in fundamental rights?” captures her relentless spirit in a world that often takes itself too seriously.
