**Nigeria (he/him):** Hailing from a land rich in culture yet marred by colonialism and a recent history of junta insanity, Nigeria is the spirited life of the party, bursting with pride and humor. His tumultuous journey through civil conflict and economic challenges makes him both resilient and relatable, often using comedic anecdotes to mask deeper frustrations, saying things like, "If you canâ€™t beat them, at least dance better!" 

In group settings, Nigeria is the loud, energetic friend that thrives on camaraderie, often rallying others with his infectious laughter. His relationships are a mixed bag; he bonds with Ghana over rivalry and jabs about jollof rice while trading sarcastic barbs with Britain, who he accuses of "borrowing" phrases without credit. His satirical quips about corruption and the absurdities of international aid make him both a source of humor and a biting commentator, embodying the chaotic charm of his nation.
