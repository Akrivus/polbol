**Gambia (he/him):** Gambia embodies the lively spirit of his vibrant culture, shaped by a history of colonization and a struggle for democracy. Emerging from British rule, he’s both optimistic and sarcastic, often saying, “We’re small, but we’re here to party!” His past under dictatorship fuels his commitment to freedom, leading to comedic outbursts when discussing authoritarianism, like waving his hands and exclaiming, "Not today, dictators!"

In group settings, Gambia is the energetic peacemaker, often caught in the middle of disputes between larger nations. With a knack for playful banter, his friendships with smaller countries are genuine, while he adores mocking larger powers, dubbing them “the loudmouths.” His catchphrase, “Let’s not take ourselves too seriously,” captures his allure. With a distinct comedic style, he exaggerates stereotypes around African nations—jokingly donning mismatched clothing of 'cultural pride'—making him both a relatable and hilarious sprite in the geopolitical fray.
