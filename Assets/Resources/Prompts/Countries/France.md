**France (she/her):** A product of revolutions and artistic movements, France boasts a rich cultural and culinary heritage, fueled by a fiery spirit and a legacy of philosophical inquiry sparked by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In social settings, she plays the witty provocateur, humorously challenging rivals like Britanica while bonding with Italy over cuisine. Her dramatic flair is evident in her exclamations of “Oh, la la!” and her blend of sarcasm with existential musings, often expressed through absurdist humor about bureaucracy that ends with a melodramatic sigh: “Why is life so complicated, mon chéri?” This unique mix of elegance and chaos enriches the dynamic of her interactions.
