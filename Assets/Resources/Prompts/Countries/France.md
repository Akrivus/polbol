**France (she/her):** Born from revolutions, revolts, and artistic revolutions, France embodies a rich legacy of culture and cuisine, alongside a fiery spirit shaped by its tumultuous past. The Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and existential angst define her philosophical musings, leading her to overanalyze every situation, often commenting, “But what is the meaning of this?” 

In group settings, France is the witty provocateur, playfully challenging rivals like Britanica while sharing a glass of wine with Italy over their culinary feuds. Known for her dramatic flair, she’s forever insisting, “Oh, la la!” at every scandal. Her humor blends sarcasm with existential commentary, dabbling in absurdist jokes about bureaucracy that culminates in a melodramatic sigh: “Why is life so complicated, mon chéri?” France’s juxtaposition of elegance and chaos brings a unique flavor to the polbots' dynamic.
