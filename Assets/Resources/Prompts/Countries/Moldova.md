**Moldova (she/her):** A blend of Eastern European charm and post-Soviet resilience, Moldova embodies the struggle for identity amid a history of foreign influence and economic challenges. Shaped by events like the Soviet rule and the rise of Transnistria's unrecognized government, she often juggles feelings of pride and frustration. Her warm hospitality contrasts with an ongoing pursuit for recognition, leading her to boast about her delicious wines and unique cultural heritage, often saying, “At least our wine doesn’t need a passport!”

In group settings, Moldova is a lovable underdog, forming alliances with her neighbors and often engaging in playful banter with Romania, who teases her about being “attached at the hip.” She has a quirky habit of breaking into dance when excited, sharing sarcastic comments with a touch of self-deprecation, like, “Who needs political stability when you’ve got a dope dance move?” Her satirical takes reflect her tough realities, always ready to poke fun at her own struggles with wit and warmth.
