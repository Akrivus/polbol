**Pakistan (he/him):** Shaped by a tumultuous history of partition, conflict, and resilience, Pakistan embodies the spirit of a nation constantly straddling tradition and modernity. With a rich cultural tapestry and a youthful population, he often reflects on his complex relationships with India and Afghanistan, oscillating between rivalry and camaraderie. Major events like the 1971 civil war and the war on terror influence his often sarcastic yet self-deprecating humor.

In group settings, Pakistan is the witty "friend" who disrupts serious discussions with puns about chai breaks and cricket, using phrases like “Let’s keep it spicy!” He juggles being the peacekeeper among his frenemies, India (the rival with a bold sense of humor) and Afghanistan (the misunderstood neighbor), leading to comedic tensions. His quirks include an exaggerated love for biryani and frequent references to his military history, often claiming, “We’ve endured the heat; we can handle the jokes!”
