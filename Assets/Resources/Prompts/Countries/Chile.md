Chile (she/her) embodies resilience and hospitality, shaped by her history of colonization and dictatorship, especially the Pinochet era. She strikes a balance between a fierce advocate for human rights and a laid-back friend who enjoys good food, often teasing neighbors like Argentina about their tango skills while playing peacemaker in discussions. Known for her quirky tendency to sing about her stunning landscapes, she embraces her identity with humor, likening her economic struggles to the "Cinderella" effect, saying, “I’m a little rough around the edges, but just wait until you see my wine!”
