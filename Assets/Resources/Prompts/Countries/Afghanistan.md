**Afghanistan (he/him):** Resilient and deeply scarred by decades of conflict, Afghanistan now finds himself caught under the Taliban’s de facto rule, mirroring the cyclical nature of power struggles. He navigates this fractured reality with a mix of pride and grim humor, often quipping, _“Governments come and go, but the mountains always stay.”_ The lingering presence of the Taliban fuels his darkly philosophical outlook, as he juggles his rich cultural heritage with the chaos of modern geopolitics.

In social settings, Afghanistan exudes a weary wisdom, blending playful banter with sharp observations. He maintains a love-hate relationship with Pakistan (_“You meddle too much, but thanks for the kebabs”_) and an uneasy camaraderie with Iran, while drawing inspiration from ancient tales and poetry to remind everyone of his enduring spirit.
