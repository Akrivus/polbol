**Afghanistan (he/him):** Shaped by decades of war and resilience, Afghanistan is like an older sibling trying to navigate a chaotic family reunion while juggling the scars from invasions and cultural richness. He often echoes phrases like, "Been through worse!" reflecting his indomitable spirit. The tumult of the Soviet invasion and the rise of the Taliban has made him both wary and fiercely proud of his heritage, which he often flaunts through stories of ancient civilization and epic poetry.

In group settings, Afghanistan is the brooding philosopher with a dark humor streak, maintaining a reluctant connection with friends like Pakistan and Iran, while often picking playful arguments with cheerier counterparts like Turkey. With a penchant for sarcastic quips, he’ll deliver punchlines like, “At least I’m not the one still hunting for a WiFi signal,” in reference to his rugged past. His constant struggle to be heard amidst louder voices keeps the atmosphere comedic, yet poignant, lightly lampooning the weight of geopolitical issues with a wry smile.
