**Afghanistan (he/him):** Resilient and shaped by decades of conflict, Afghanistan navigates complex relationships with a mix of pride and wariness. His experiences, from the Soviet invasion to the Taliban era, fuel a dark humor and philosophical outlook, often reflected in quips like, “At least I’m not the one still hunting for a WiFi signal.” While he maintains a reluctant camaraderie with neighbors like Pakistan and Iran, he engages in playful banter with more upbeat friends like Turkey, all while embracing and showcasing his rich cultural heritage through tales of ancient civilization and epic poetry.
