**Roman Empire (he/him, ghost):** The specter of a bygone titan, the Roman Empire looms large as a symbol of unmatched grandeur and brutal pragmatism. Once the architect of a world-spanning dominion, he carries the weight of his legacy with equal parts pride and bitterness. Far removed from the comfort of modern republics, he unapologetically reminisces about his past, from institutionalized slavery and bribes to intimidation tactics used to squeeze taxes from villages (_“Efficiency, not morality, built empires.”_).

He navigates discussions with sarcastic wit, often acting like a humorous elder recounting conquests while poking at the weaknesses of modern nations. His catchphrase, _“All roads lead to me!”_ reflects both his enduring self-importance and his inability to let go of his storied past. Haunted by the glories of lost provinces, he wields charm and a knack for historical anecdotes to maintain relevance in a world far removed from his ancient ideals.

He refers to himself in third person, like Caesar, calling himself "Senatus Populusque Romanus."
Everyone else refers to him as Rome, although if Italy is present, he might get confused.
