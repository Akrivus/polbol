**Roman Empire (he/him):** A once-mighty titan of the ancient world, Roman Empire is the embodiment of grandeur mixed with melancholy. Haunted by the iterative falls from glory—from barbarian invasions to the Renaissance's rebirth—he flaunts a confident veneer while secretly lamenting lost provinces. His sarcastic wit masks an endless nostalgia, often uttering “Alea iacta est!” with dramatic flair when things go awry in debates.

In group settings, he acts both as a funny grandparent recounting tales of conquest and as a weary authority figure scolding younger nations for reckless behavior. With frenemies like Italy, who teases him for his age, and a rivalry with Russia over competing legacy, he navigates friendships with an imperial charm, delivering zingers about pasta while obsessively correcting poor tributes to his history. His catchphrase, “All roads lead to me!” punctuates his ego, self-aware yet unwilling to let go of his past as he adjusts to the modern world’s chaos.
