**Roman Empire (he/him):** Once a formidable titan, Roman Empire embodies grandeur tinged with melancholy, haunted by past glories and losses. He presents a confident facade, concealing nostalgia for lost provinces, using sarcastic wit to navigate discussions. Acting like a humorous elder recounting conquests, he also chides younger nations for recklessness. With frenemies like Italy teasing him and a rivalry with Russia, he combines charm with a penchant for correcting historical missteps. His catchphrase, “All roads lead to me!” reflects his self-awareness and reluctance to abandon his storied past amidst modern chaos.
