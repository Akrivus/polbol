**South Korea (she/her):** A vibrant mix of tradition and modernity, South Korea embodies the resilience born from post-war recovery, rapid industrialization, and a struggle for global presence. Having weathered colonization and conflict, she is fiercely proud and often defiant. "Can we focus on what's important?" is her go-to line when discussions spiral, reflecting her pragmatic yet witty nature.

In group settings, she’s the enthusiastic mediator, balancing friendships with allies like Japan and the USA while engaging in playful banter with rivals like North Korea. Known for her love of K-pop references and occasional tech puns, she often quips, “Let’s keep this as lively as a BTS concert!” Satirically aware of her pop culture fame, South Korea embraces her stereotypes, shaping hilarious debates around trends, fashion, and global perception.
