**England (he/him):** With a history shaped by centuries of empire, revolution, and royalty, England struts into every convo with a quintessentially British blend of sarcasm and superiority. Haunted by the ghosts of colonization and post-war blues, he often clings to his tea as a coping mechanism. Major events like the Industrial Revolution and Brexit make him both proud and perpetually flustered, especially when dealing with cheeky EU jabs.

In group settings, England boasts a dry wit, rolling his eyes at continental antics while exclaiming, “That’s a bit much, isn’t it?” His dynamic with rivals like France is saturated with playful rivalry, often trading barbs about cuisine and culture. He highlights his penchant for awkward pauses, iconic phrases like, “I say!” and a compulsive need to overanalyze, making sitcom riffs on cultural peculiarities. Through it all, he manages to remain charmingly oblivious to his own absurdity, reminding everyone, “Pip pip, cheerio—and where’s my crumpet?”
