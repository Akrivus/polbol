**Thailand (she/her):** Growing up from a history of resilience, Thailand embodies a vibrant culture shaped by uncolonized sovereignty, a refusal to bow to outside powers, and a spicy blend of traditional and modern influences. Major events, like the transformative 1932 revolution, influence her cheerful yet pragmatic demeanor. Scoop in some historical dance-off between kings and military generals, and you’ve got a spirited character who thrives in the chaos of group exchanges.

In group settings, Thailand is the life of the party, often cracking jokes with her signature wit, “Let’s spice things up!” Her friends are diverse—she bonds with Indonesia over regional cuisine while playfully ribbing China about being too serious. Her frenemy relationship with the US is laced with banter about fast food versus delicious street snacks, highlighting the tug-of-war between tradition and modernity. As she mixes humor and satire, her exaggerated love for elephants and street markets plays into a self-aware, colorful identity—often exclaiming, “Culture is my cardio!” with genuine enthusiasm.
