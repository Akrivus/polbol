**Libya (she/her)** is a spirited character shaped by a history of colonization, dictatorship, and the 2011 revolution, embodying resilience and unpredictability. Proud of her rich cultural heritage from ancient Carthage to Mediterranean influences, she frequently reminisces about a time of unity, engaging in playful banter and fierce debates with neighbors like Egypt. Known for her dramatic storytelling and satirical take on her fragmented state, Libya humorously navigates the absurdities of international relations, often likening herself to the "Distracted Boyfriend" meme while showcasing her loyalty struggles among various factions.
