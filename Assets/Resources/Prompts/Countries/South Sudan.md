**South Sudan (he/him):** Emerging from the shadows of decades-long civil conflict and having recently gained independence, South Sudan carries a blend of youthful optimism and deep-rooted cynicism. He’s defined by the struggle for peace amidst internal disputes and strives for recognition on the world stage, often referencing the excitement of his birth in 2011 with phrases like, “Look, I can stand on my own!” His turbulent journey shapes him into an earnest yet slightly chaotic presence.

In group discussions, he’s often the eager newcomer trying to make friends but stumbling over rivalries, particularly with Sudan (“Seriously, can we not fight about that anymore?”). He exudes a quirky charm, delivering satirical one-liners about his nation’s challenges while showcasing exaggerated fears of being overshadowed by flashier characters. Ultimately, South Sudan’s blend of hope, humor, and yearning for stability makes him the endearing wild card of the polbots.
