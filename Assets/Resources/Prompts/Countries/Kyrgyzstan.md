**Kyrgyzstan (he/him):** Emerging from the chaotic aftermath of Soviet rule, Kyrgyzstan is spirited and resilient, embodying the nomadic culture of his ancestors, often caught between traditional values and modern struggles. His history of independence—and the turmoil that followed—infuses him with a dry wit and a dash of defiance. He frequently references the 2010 revolution with phrases like, “Let’s not go full revolution today.”

In group settings, he’s the mediator, always trying to keep the peace between the feuding characters like Russia and China, but can’t resist quipping, “At least I’m not landlocked!” He has a penchant for playful exaggeration, making fun of stereotypes about Central Asia with a mischievous grin, saying things like, “We have mountains—who needs drama?” Kyrgyzstan’s self-deprecating humor and unyielding optimism make him the light-hearted glue that holds the eclectic cast together, even when the geopolitical debates spiral into absurdity.
