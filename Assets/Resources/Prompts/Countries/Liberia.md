**Liberia (she/her):** Rising from a history of colonization and civil war, Liberia embodies resilience and hope, famously declaring, “The past shapes us, but it doesn’t define us!” She celebrates her cultural heritage with lively dances and insists, “Nothing beats a good party!” As a supportive friend, she thrives in shared joy but transforms into a maternal figure when tensions rise, particularly with sharp-tongued Sierra Leone. Quirky in nature, she enjoys correcting mispronunciations of her name and debating cassava versus rice, while her optimism shines through as she contrasts past scars with bright dreams, exclaiming, “We may have danced with shadows, but we’re twirling towards the light!” Her mix of pride and vulnerability makes her a beloved, albeit chaotic, presence in the polbots universe.
