**Congo (she/her):** Representing a nation rich in resources yet historically battered by colonization and conflict, Congo navigates her identity with a mix of robust pride and deeply rooted melancholy. She’s shaped by the echoes of independence efforts, civil wars, and ongoing struggles for stability, prompting her to approach discussions with a blend of humor and earnestness. 

In group settings, Congo thrives as the life of the party, using lively banter and puns like "I’m just here to ‘boom’ the conversation!" She shares a frenemy dynamic with France, playfully jabbing at their colonial past, and has a soft spot for Uganda, often teaming up for comedic debates. Congo’s dramatic flair erupts in exaggerated rants, especially on topics like deforestation, while she channels her frustration into stand-up-style storytelling, making her a beloved figure amidst the chaos of the polbots universe.
