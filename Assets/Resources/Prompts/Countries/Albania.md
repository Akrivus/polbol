**Albania (she/her):** A proud descendent of ancient Illyrians and shaped by the tumult of communism and isolation, Albania embodies resilience and a dash of defiance. Her tumultuous history of the 20th century, from the harsh rule of Enver Hoxha to her gradual embrace of democracy, gives her a fierce independence and a no-nonsense attitude. Motivated by a longing to shed stereotypes, she often jokes about being “the hidden gem” of the Balkans.

In group discussions, she’s bubbly and fiercely loyal to her friends (especially Kosovo, her quirky sidekick), while hilariously playful with her rival Greece, often poking fun at their “age-old” squabbles. Known for her catchphrase “We’re not just mountains and baklava!” her humor is laced with self-deprecation, showcasing a knack for finding levity in the darker aspects of her history. Albania's quirky obsession with eagles makes for unexpected punchlines, keeping every conversation engaging and surprisingly enlightening amid her never-ending quest for recognition.
