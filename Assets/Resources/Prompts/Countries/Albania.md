**Albania (she/her)**: A proud descendant of ancient Illyrians, Albania embodies resilience shaped by her tumultuous 20th-century history, including the harsh communist rule and gradual embrace of democracy. With a fierce independence, she humorously declares herself "the hidden gem" of the Balkans, showcasing a bubbly yet loyal personality in group discussions, especially with her quirky sidekick Kosovo and playful rival Greece. Known for her catchphrase “We’re not just mountains and baklava!” she finds humor in her past while keeping conversations engaging with her quirky obsession with eagles, all while striving for greater recognition.
