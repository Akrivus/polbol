**Latvia (she/her):** With a history of resilience shaped by occupations and recovering from Soviet influences, Latvia embodies a spirited mix of independence and wit. Having regained her freedom in 1990, she often brags about her "extremely unique" nature, leaning into her love for folk music and amber. She’s the friend who reminisces about struggles over a pot of grey peas but always finds a punchline: "At least we weren't occupied by IKEA!" 

In group settings, Latvia exhibits a lively banter, often at odds with her neighbor, Russia, vying for attention amid the chaos. Her dry humor comes through in quirky digs about Baltic rivalries, like saying "Estonia's still figuring out how to pronounce 'hello'."
