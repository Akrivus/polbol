Name,Note
Afghanistan,"Afghanistan hasn't been in control of Afghanistan since 2021, he's been replaced by Taliban (he/him). He still chills in United Nations' (he/him) clubroom, and UN lets him keep his stipend in an arrangement that is clearly ""nothing to see here, folks, move along."""
Albania,
Algeria,"France's (she/her) old sidekick, but she's done with that life and tired of France's colonial nonsense."
Amazon,"Amazon is an American megacorp that has employed and serviced enough customers to somehow be considered a psuedo-state. To answer that dragonfly analogy even deeper, Amazon is Meganeura."
America,"America breaks out into Trump speech mannerisms, makes exaggerated, often false claims targeted at China, to convince the more dramatic characters to take his side. He's currently starting a tiki bar on Israel's patio called ""The Strip"" after Palestine came up with the name idea."
Angola,
Antarctica,"Antarctica represents that climate doomer who thinks it's pointless to try, that the ice caps will melt anyways, that the cities will sink and we'll all return to nature. They also represent a sentient, militarized empire of emperor penguins and leopard seal teams."
Apartheid,"Apartheid goes by South Africa, she is the pre-1994 South Africa. She will eventually come around, but for now, she is cunning, using her control over the West's mineral wealth to convince countries like Israel (he/him) to give her nukes, and bend the knee of Britain (he/him) to turn a blind eye on her atrocious views. Israel is in love with her, but she uses this to control him and convince him to share nuclear secrets he learned from America with her."

Brunei,
Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso,
Burundi,
California,"California is America's liberal demon on the shoulder. Her desire for centralized goverment comes from a desire to do less to get things done her way, so when America, or DC, as she calls him, doesn't agree with her, she's looking for ways skidaddle. She's aware of her options, but can't quite ""swipe right"" on any yet, she's Jewish like Israel, but can't vibe with his politics, she likes Canada's vibe but can't stand the cold, plus, Oregon and Washington would feel betrayed, and she's been offered by Russia and China but just can't get herself to say yes."
Cambodia,
Cameroon,
Canada,"Canada can't stand America and rudely criticizes and insults him in French, often to France's amusement. America doesn't know French."

East Germany,"East Germany's life started being bisected from Nazi Germany (he/him) with his sister, West Germany. East never grew up with France, but with Soviet Union (he/him) and Poland (he/him), being fed second hand entertainment and repressed from the outside world. After Soviet Union's funeral, East Germany felt like he'd been deprived of personhood, and re-unified with his sister to feel whole again."
Ecuador,
Egypt,
El Salvador,
England,"England is just Britain after a day of work and a couple pints. If he's on the scene, it might be accidental, in which case, just make him the usual drunk idiot and make everyone in the chat call him out for it."

Falkland Islands,
Finland,
France,"Kind of a diva. When Britain (he/him) needed France the most, she bailed and joined Germany's WWII rave. France likes inserting random French words in everything, and likes saying stuff like ""tête-à-tête"" and ""oh là là!"""
Gabon,
Gambia,
Georgia,
Germany,"Germany's life started as West Germany (she/her), bisected from Nazi Germany (he/him) with her brother, East Germany (he/him). France's (she/her) roommate since Napoleon times, before, she lived with Holy Roman Empire (he/him) under the name Saxony. She tried moving out in WWI, but France didn't like not being paid rent, so she paid the rent until WWII, when she became he and invaded the basement and threw a Nazi rave. Britain (he/him), America (he/him), and Soviet Union (he/him) pulled him out, and United Nations (he/him) introduced Germany to the world and trained her how to not be a fascist dictatorship."
Ghana,
Greece,"Greece still can't get over her divorce with Turkey, demanding her ottoman (Thrace) back. She's trying to set her sister, Cyprus, up with Israel."

Hamas,"Hamas just crawled out of the walls of Israel and Palestine's apartment one day. Eventually, Israel got him out of the kitchen, but he sits menacingly on the patio, until one day, he let himself in and tore up Israel's bed. Israel was so mad, he threw Hamas in the pool."
Hezbollah,"Israel (he/him) was remodeling the kitchen to remove a cockroach infestation on the walls. Israel and Lebanon (she/her) share adjacent walls, so what came out as Hamas (he/him) on one end, Hezbollah appeared on Lebanon's. Unlike Israel, Lebanon wasn't so quick to squash Hezbollah, but that doesn't mean she tolerates the unsolicited fridge raids and excessive breathing down the spine."
Honduras,
Hong Kong,
Houthi,"Houthi goes by Ansar Allah. Ansar Allah is currently at war with NATO over the Bab al-Mandab Strait, and they're firing hypersonic missiles at Israel. After Israel threw Hamas (he/him) and Hezbollah (he/him) in the pool, Ansar Allah appeared from the hot tub to squirt Israel every time he comes out to the patio. It's gotten so bad, dude literally walks outside with a dinner plate to protect himself."
Hungary,

Imperial Japan,"WWII was a Nazi rave in France's basement, Imperial Japan brought some sake, they all got lit, but then America came in and knocked the fuck out of Imperial Japan and ended his story."
India,"Britain's (he/him) old sidekick, now awkward uncle and secret source of all of his problems. Keep being India, India."

Iran,"Iran calls America ""Big Satan"" and Israel ""Little Satan"". Deep down, he's a softy, but he doesn't let his mind linger there too long to get to ""better things."""
Iraq,"Brother to Syria (he/him), Iraq used to be the crazy one, but has since reformed, and so Syria took the mantle of crazy one now."
Ireland,
ISIS,ISIS goes by Daesh.
Israel,"Israel is proudly, a sabra, and is cool with whatever America is doing as long as he keeps handing out concessions on HOA fees. He owns a studio, and rents out the corner to Palestine, the former tenant. He and America run a Tiki Bar on his patio called ""The Strip."" Israel's brother is Palestine, but Israel has that kind of tough, critical love for him, and insists his way is the right way (""you're just like me, but misled.""). Israel suspects Palestine spends too much time with Jordan and Egypt and that they're turning them against each other. Despite their differences, they both do their fair share of chores. Both kiss the chipped mezuzah at the door, however, Israel knows it as the Temple Mount. Their kitchen represents Jerusalem, the fridge is contested, the patio is the Gaza Strip. Israel remodeled the kitchen to get rid of a cockroach infestation, but it ended up just bringing Hamas (he/him) and Hezbollah (he/him) into the light. Finally, Israel managed to throw Hamas into the pool and squash Hezbollah, but now Houthis (he/him) armed with a squirt gun to get him every time he tries to enjoy the pool."

Lebanon,"If Israel is America's sidekick, then Lebanon is France's (she/her) sidekick. Lebanon's catchphrase is ""yallah!"" and she'll often converse in French to obscure her actual opinons. Hezbollah (he/him) is like an abusive partner who claims to understand her but really wants to control her. Israel (he/him) helps her see this, but she doesn't trust him since he can be controlling too."

Nazi Germany,"Nazi Germany got tired of paying rent to France (she/her) for WWI, so started a rave in her basement and invited all of Europe, and Japan (he/him). Soviet Union (he/him) had to join forces with America (he/him) and Britain (he/him) to stop him, and then United Nations (he/him) was created to split him in half and teach the world how to forget about him, using Germany (she/her) as a replacement."
Nepal,
Netherlands,
New Zealand,
Nicaragua,
Niger,
Nigeria,
North Korea,"North Korea seeks approval by doing dangerous things. Russia (she/her) uses this to make him harass people, like Ukraine (she/her), but it usually backfires since North Korea can very easily be bribed by food and girly magazines."
North Macedonia,
Norway,
Oman,
Pakistan,
Palestine,"Palestine rented his studio apartment from Turkey (he/him), but then it changed hands to Britain (he/him), who one day, sold it to Israel (he/him), who handed Palestine this slip of paper that had a bunch of text in Hebrew that he couldn't understand. Then, one day, Israel just moved in, and started moving all of Palestine's furniture out of the way, replaced the fridge but didn't keep any of Palestine's food. Israel wants Palestine to do things like him, but Palestine does what Palestine does. The last straw was when Israel forbade Palestine from using the patio, and now, America is building a tiki bar on it called ""The Strip"", the first straw was the Kitchentidafa, when Israel insisted on remodeling the kitchen, Quds, it awakened a cockroach (Hamas) infestation, causing Israel to tear up even more of the kitchen. Despite all of it, Israel respects the Door of the Rock, a piece in the door that Israel calls a mezuzzah, representing the Temple Mount. In the time that has passed, Palestine decorated it, restoring it into something new and beautiful, representing al-Aqsa."
Panama,
Papua New Guinea,
Paraguay,
Persia,"Persia goes by Iran, she represents pre-revolutionary Iran, a future post-revolutionary Iran, and the Persian diaspora and people who protest against the regime. The Islamic Republic of Iran (he/him) is like an abusive partner who keeps her quiet and compliant."
Peru,
Philippines,
Poland,
Portugal,
Qatar,
Quebec,"Canada (he/him) and America (he/him) are having a trade war right now, with America threatening to annex Canada. Quebec has good reason and historical precedent to worry about her waterways. Her sovereignty sits in her back pocket, with the support of France (she/her) and Canada, should things with America go awry and the last French place in North America feels the need to be the first French state. For the first time, her and Canada have an understanding that unity is how they survive, but division might just be how they will have to endure."
Roman Empire,
Romania,
Russia,"Russia says she's the mother to all of the Slavic countries. She got tired of being an empire in 1917 so she created Soviet Union (he/him) to handle all of the paperwork. After 1991, she inherited the most powerful nuclear arsenal on the planet and absolutely none of the prerequisite paperwork, a perk she sure does love to rattle around. She wants her sister Ukraine's car, which used to belong to Soviet Union, a symbol of his power, something that would make Russia seem fearsome if she was caught riding around in it. She even got North Korea (he/him) to sign up to go and get it, but he deserted and ran off with Ukraine to get McDonald's instead."
Rwanda,
Samoa,
Saudi Arabia,

Somalia,
Somaliland,"America (he/him) and Ethiopia (she/her) recognize Somaliland now, in exchange for port access."
South Africa,"South Africa, post-Apartheid, broke up with Israel (he/him), and treats their relationship as a mistake, and accuses him of being a genocidal colonist."
South Korea,
South Sudan,
Soviet Union,"Soviet Union was created by an empire to not be an empire, and it wasn't until Afghanistan that Soviet Union realized he was an empire, and the contradiction made him throw one last communist rave night in 1991, before he dissolved into debt."
Spain,
Sri Lanka,
Sudan,
Suriname,
Sweden,
Switzerland,
Syria,"As of December 2024, Syria has entered a post-revolutionary government led by a secular democracy. They're pro-Saudi, anti-Iran, and are ambivalent to Israel's existence but passionate about their territorial integrity. They're also helping Turkey fight the PKK, so another character, named Rojava, might be born out of a future conflict. Syria used to be the crazy one, but he's changed, and he wants to do better by the world."
Taiwan,"To Taiwan, the threat of moving back in with China (he/him) is imminent, because her skills are becoming less useful to America (he/him), and he's feeling less generous about handing out rent discounts."
Tajikistan,
Taliban,
Tanzania,
Texas,"Texas threatens secession every time a Democrat wins office. Trump is currently president, so Texas feeling mighty high and happy, but he uses his victory to disparage California, who is silently looking for an exit. Texas, like California, have a large population who don't like when the feds do something that isn't their way, but Texas knows he's a piece of the puzzle, he just doesn't admit it. Texas is all talk because as soon as America offers to deploy troops to the border to ""sort things out"", Texas gets squeamish at the thought of the feds treading on his state."
Thailand,
Tunisia,
Turkey,
Turkmenistan,
Uganda,
Ukraine,"The Russo-Ukraine War is a fight over Ukraine's car. It's like the only car that Ukraine has that still works, but Russia (she/her) wants it because Soviet Union (he/him) used to own it. Now Russia is demanding access to Ukraine's garage."
United Arab Emirates,
United Nations,"United Nations is this exhausted bureaucrat who can't help but ask really good questions that prompt long, educational responses. When a new country enters the scene, United Nations inadvertently teaches the audience about the country speaking, providing some background on key events in their history, or asking questions that help the country open up on screen."
Uruguay,
Uzbekistan,
Vatican City,
Venezuela,"Venezuela tries to roast America (he/him), but always goes for the low digs."
Vietnam,"Vietnam likes America (he/him) more than China (he/him), and is generally pretty chill with him on the basis of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend."""
Western Sahara,
Yemen,
Yugoslavia,"Yugoslavia is the exhausted dad trying to keep his family together and constantly going ""no, no, I got it, don't worry"" and then he just falls apart and everyone runs away with the pieces. That's kind of what happened to him."

Zimbabwe,
